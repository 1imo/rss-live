      "title": "Formula Legends Review",
      "description": "",
      "content": "From the makers of Paw Patrol Grand Prix and Gigantosaurus: Dino Kart, comes… Formula Legends, an off-brand, Formula One-inspired arcade racer. Yes, it’s certainly true that developer 3DClouds’ primary output appears to be racing games aimed at an extremely young audience so, on paper, Formula Legends might sound easy to cruise on past for those of you who are no longer eating spaghetti with your hands. However, if you’re a fan of the long and storied history of Formula 1 racing – as well as games like Art of Rally, Circuit Superstars, and Micro Machines – Formula Legends might prove to be a dark horse in the race. This colourful, toy-like arcade racer consistently impresses thanks to its charming and evolving approach to showcasing the many, many eras it represents, although the fun is punctured somewhat by a slightly laggy handling model, some annoyingly uneven AI, and its lack of multiplayer.In case it’s not obvious by its chunky car caricatures and cartoon-adjacent art style, Formula Legends is not here to compete against the likes of Codemasters’ modern F1 series. Those games are mostly for hardcore fans who crave a realistic approach, but also tweakable enough to remain approachable for newcomers and younger players – indeed, that’s one of their real strengths. But where F1 2025 is seeking to be a credible simulation of a current elite sport, like its peers on the football pitch or basketball court, Formula Legends is still very serious about faithfully paying homage to the sport of F1 in a delightfully comprehensive way that older fans can appreciate.Through Goes HammertonTaking a greatest hits-style approach to the history of the world’s premier, open-wheel motorsport, Formula Legends boasts a career mode that covers seven decades – stretching all the way back to the ’60s. On top of this, most of these decades are broken up into multiple mini-eras covering the early, mid, and late phases of these periods. The car models, drivers, and the teams they race for are constantly shaken up across each championship. Many of these championships are locked until you complete the one prior to it, but there are entry points in each decade. This feels like a good balance between giving us plenty to unlock, but also the flexibility to hop around the different eras as we choose. You won’t have to chronologically move all the way from the late ’60s to today – through 70-odd years of racing – just to unlock Formula Legends' most modern car and driver combinations. You can do a vintage championship, head into the 2020s, and then jump back to the ’90s if you want to. All the while you’ll be unlocking new content. It’s all very well considered.We ought to note that Formula Legends is completely unaffiliated with real-life F1, so there are no licensed cars or driver names. This kind of thing comes with its own sort of charm, however: Not only does it remind me of the equally unlicensed sports games full of cheeky soundalikes I played in my youth, but part of the fun for me has been discovering the silly aliases 3DClouds has cooked up for its huge timeline of teams and drivers. This means being introduced to the likes of Osvald Pastry, Charlie Lacreme, and Luis Hammerton, and also past drivers like Dave Coulthsoft, Marvin Brubble, and Mike and Malf Shoemaker. Some of them stretch the bounds of a good pun to the point of being a bit too obtuse or confusing – and it could’ve done with one more edit pass from the development team to catch quirks like Alan Jones… I mean, Al John inexplicably migrating from Australia to New Zealand in the 1980s – but it’s cute stuff overall.[No licensed cars or driver names] means being introduced to the likes of Osvald Pastry, Charlie Lacreme, and Luis Hammerton, and also past drivers like Dave Coulthsoft, Marvin Brubble, and Mike and Malf Shoemaker.The cars look great, and I like how their squat frames and exaggerated features make them look like the sort of Micro Machines I would’ve climbed over every kid in my class for back in the late ’80s. They sound great too, thanks to the fact that Formula Legends’ engine sounds profoundly change for each era. Well, they don’t all sound great, because the real modern F1 is limp and wheezy compared to the primal screaming present in the age of V10s – but that’s not 3DClouds’ fault. Actually, there’s currently a sound bug that causes the engine noise for the modern cars to sometimes drop out for extended periods. It's a fault I’m sure 3DClouds will seek to fix as soon as feasible, but it’s probably an indictment on today’s V6 turbo-hybrids that I didn’t really miss hearing them that much.Spanning so many eras of racing has also compelled 3DClouds to get clever with how it handles the vast differences between old-school racing tracks and their dramatically refurbished incarnations. For this, many tracks have up to three different versions: vintage, classic, and modern. As with the drivers and cars, the tracks are unlicensed – but they each contain enough recognisable nods to famous corners and track segments that there’s no question which ones they’re homages to. I really enjoy how tailored the tracks are to each era. Vintage tracks make liberal use of hay bales as their one and only concession to driver safety, and they’re largely surrounded by quaint countryside, while their modern versions are lined with curbs and wrap around areas that have since become huge, built-up racing precincts. Better yet, while some tracks evolve upon a single recognisable layout – like the circuits for Belgium or Italy (which riff on Spa and Monza, respectively) – others find themselves totally reinvented. The vintage German circuit is an extensively long track that winds through a forest, mimicking the full Nürburgring Nordschleife that F1 cars used to race on, but the classic and modern German track is a shorter and more conventional GP circuit. Similarly, the classic Australian track has a clearly different layout and aesthetic to the modern track, mirroring the real-world differences between the Adelaide street circuit of the late ’80s/early ’90s and the current circuit in Melbourne’s Albert Park. It’s this kind of attention to detail that tells me that this is not being phoned in. There are even optional visual filters that give vintage races a warmer, old-school film tone and classic races a bright, CRT TV effect to better situate them in the ’80s and ’90s. It’s a really well-curated and crafted career mode, and you can tell the team are firm F1 fans from the commitment to these small details that’s on display.Turn AroundThe disappointing part of Formula Legends is that it doesn’t always hold up out on track. There are some circuits where I’m able to get into a pretty good groove – particularly after several laps of the layout to learn the corners. However, there are a few too many other occasions where it’s difficult to find the right rhythm without yawing side to side trying to correct my line coming out of corners. I think the reason behind this is that there’s some odd lag in the steering – like it’s not responsive enough. It makes rapid changes of direction, like chicanes, quite frustrating at times. The change of angle coming a fraction late does take some getting used to. A bit more sharpness to those controls would have been preferable.I like playing Formula Legends from its most distant camera setting (a cockpit camera is included, but it wasn’t my preferred view) because that’s where it reminds me most of Art of Rally (and where I feel it’s at its best; a more top-down view takes the edge off the numbness in the handling model). The difference is, Art of Rally doesn’t have a gaggle of other AI cars to contend with – and it’s Formula Legends’ AI cars that are one of its key weaknesses.It’s quite annoying how impactful even minor contact with your AI opponents can be. Essentially, any scrape with a car on the outside of you during a corner will completely overrule your steering, causing you to understeer directly into a wall or off track, and even a light touch from behind will cause other cars to immediately slow down dramatically and trap you behind them. The inconsistent AI, which comes in just three settings (easy, normal, and hard) is a significant bugbear, especially since there’s no multiplayer mode in which to race against friends. The main problem is how much their proficiency varies between circuits. On a lot of tracks I found it entirely straightforward to keep the normal AI behind me throughout a race, sometimes pulling out to quite large leads. However, on some tracks (especially Formula Legends’ version of Monaco) they’re supernaturally quicker for no apparent reason. That should be no problem because you can just turn down the difficulty for those tracks, right? Unfortunately not: the difficulty level can’t be adjusted between races during a championship – once it’s set, it’s set for all subsequent races.Formula Legends would be much improved with an AI system we’re able to adjust with a bit more granularity.Formula Legends would be much improved with an AI system we’re able to adjust with a bit more granularity. Something like that could help keep the pack closer together, particularly since tyre wear, dynamic weather, and pit stops are all factors in Formula Legends’ racing. Having to think about your pit stop strategy throughout a race is a nice touch, but making those snap decisions to pit (or stay out for one more lap) would be a lot more tense if we could find a way to bring the racing closer on a more regular basis.",

      "description": "",
      "content": "Spoilers ahead for Peacemaker: Season 2, Episode 6 (“Ignorance is Chris”).The latest episode of Peacemaker paid off that big DCU cameo that James Gunn has been hinting at for awhile now. A.R.G.U.S. boss Rick Flag, Sr. (Frank Grillo) is desperate to locate both Peacemaker (John Cena) and his interdimensional portal-opening device in an attempt to prevent any more dimensional rifts like the one that befell Metropolis in Superman. So Flag seeks out a man who knows a thing or two about them … Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult).Flag visits Belle Reve prison where the fallen tech genius is currently doing a 265-year sentence for nearly destroying Metropolis (and also, presumably, for the treacherous warmongering shenanigans he was up to overseas).“We have a really important moment for not only Peacemaker but the entire DCU in that Rick Flag, the head of A.R.G.U.S., strikes a deal basically with Lex Luthor in exchange for Lex Luthor finding where Peacemaker's portal might be,” Gunn explains in the latest episode of Peacemaker The Official Podcast with James Gunn. “He is going to move him from a prison with metahumans to a prison with no metahumans, from Belle Reve, where they are now, to Van Kull, both prisons from the comics. And then he leaves and tells Sol-- tells Sasha Bordeaux that he's teamed up with Lex Luthor, which is scary. A man with such power as Flag, who obviously, you know, has some. He's got an agenda. It's scary for our boy Peacemaker.”Luthor has a scanning device that will allow Flag to track down Peacemaker and his portal-opening box, and although he wants his freedom, he accepts Flag’s offer for a shot at “redemption.” Lex, who is using a cane and limping, also really wants to get away from metahumans, and this change of venues will allow for that.Given that Gunn recently confirmed that Peacemaker Season 2 leads directly into his Superman follow-up film Man of Tomorrow, Flag’s deal with Luthor suggests that it’s just the first step in a journey that will eventually see Superman having to work with Luthor to confront a bigger threat.Elsewhere in the podcast, Gunn revealed that Luthor’s cameo was shot during the filming of Flag’s Pentagon scenes in Superman. Gunn, who wrote and directed Episode 6, also said Luthor’s cameo was originally going to appear in Episode 7.“That is the other thing that I moved besides the openings of [Episodes] 2 and 4, which I switched around. And the reason being that the next scene was so serious and heavy that I needed an in-between scene,” Gunn said. “And luckily, I had shot both of them, so it wasn't a weird directing thing for me to just steal a scene from the next episode.”For more, be sure to read our Peacemaker: Season 2, Episode 6 review.What did you think of the Lex Luthor cameo and Flag’s deal with him? Sound off in the comments.",

      "content": "Full spoilers follow for Peacemaker Season 2, Episode 6 - “Ignorance Is Chris.”Nazi planet.The internet called it a few weeks back, and now, as we enter the final stretch of the season, we finally have confirmation that John Cena’s Peacemaker’s happy place, his Best Dimension Ever, is actually a world of Nazis. Or at the very least a country of Nazis. They even have a Nazi American flag!But that’s not all that happens in “Ignorance Is Chris,” which, after a fairly slow-moving season, finally shifts into high gear in its last 10 minutes, with each of its main characters facing a dramatic and dangerous turn. Let’s start with the buzziest.Frank Grillo’s Rick Flag Sr. had made a deal with the devil now that A.R.G.U.S. is, as he puts it, “partners with Lex Luthor.” Yes, Nicholas Hoult pops over from this past summer’s Superman long enough to hook Rick Sr. up with a way to trace Peacemaker’s dimensional portal. We figured something big was happening this week since HBO didn’t make advance screeners of this episode available for critics, not to mention that James Gunn (who wrote and directed this segment) is doing interviews for “Ignorance Is Chris” as well (more on that this weekend after we talk to him).Is it just me or does Hoult play Lex here a little colder, a little more serious, a little scarier than he did in Superman? Maybe it’s just the more adult approach Peacemaker as a show affords its characters (amid their silliness), or perhaps it’s a result of Lex’s bitterness after, from his perspective, his trying to save the world from “the metahuman blight” and was instead thrown into Belle Reve for life (or 265 years, whichever comes first) to live among the super-people whom he hates.So then who is the real villain of this season?The thing is, despite all of Rick Sr.’s talk about not wanting to deal with another dimensional rift like what went down in Superman, it’s become increasingly clear that he has a bigger agenda beyond that, and here he confirms to Lex that he has “another idea” for what to do once he finds Chris’ tech. What is that idea? Start placing your bets now, but whatever it turns out to be, the scene between Hoult and Grillo is nicely played, even as it further drives home that Rick Sr. isn’t really the villain of this season as much as he’s operating in that morally grey area that can lead to good people making bad decisions.So then who is the real villain of this season? Well, I guess it’s the Nazi planet. While Harcourt (Jennifer Holland), upon landing in this dimension, immediately noticed what Chris did not – the lack of people of color – Danielle Brooks’ Ads is of course the one who is targeted as soon as she steps outside of the Nazi Smith house. Things start slowly, with a woman driving by and staring, but soon enough the neighborhood devolves into an Invasion of the Body Snatchers situation as they’re chasing her down the street. That includes Keith (David Denman), Chris’ brother who, like Robert Patrick’s alternate dimension Auggie, has seemed like a pretty lovable guy up until this point. But then he’s yelling “One got out! A black!” Weird how a pretty lovable guy can turn out to be a monster.This big reveal – though Gunn must’ve known we’d all figure it out before now – is cross-cut with the rest of the 11th Street Kids finding themselves in various degrees of trouble. Steve Agee’s Economos, as a result of the pretty dumb plan to just hang around the Smith house and hope Chris comes home, of course runs into Auggie, not Chris. The Blue Dragon may be old now, but he’s still fast, and he easily takes Economos down before putting a blade through his hand, causing Economos to spill his guts on every little detail about Chris Prime… who of course killed Auggie’s Chris.Adrian (Freddie Stroma), finally back in his Vigilante suit, has his dream come true and meets the alt-Adrian. And they are indeed an exact match, which of course leads to lots of Gunn weirdness and yuck-yucks… until alt-Adrian lets loose that he hates Peacemaker. And that’s why he joined the Sons of Liberty even!The Sons of Liberty, of course, was the terrorist organization that tried to blow up a building back in Episode 3 before Chris put a lethal (and quite exciting) stop to them. Fans were speculating at the time, and I’d bet you dollars to donuts that they were right on this one as well, that the Sons are actually freedom fighters in the Nazi dimension. Which, among other things, means that Chris didn’t just kill his alt-self, but also a bunch of do-gooders in this world too. Worst Dimension Ever.And then there’s Chris and Harcourt. Not only does Chris find that Nazi flag in the end – surely a deflating moment for any hero and patriot, let alone one who thought he had found the perfect life in this world – but the situation with him and Harcourt and the other Harcourt are all coming to a boil. And between Chris and our Harcourt, things are way complicated. Like this complicated:Chris: “I know you don't hate me.”Harcourt: “I know you know I don't.”Chris: “But I'm in love with you, Emilia.”Harcourt: “Yeah, I know.”Chris: “Yeah, I figured.”It’s another really good scene in an episode with a bunch, and quite a feat when one considers not just how Cena’s Peacemaker started out back in The Suicide Squad, but also the emotional gymnastics that the actor and Holland are doing here.And that’s before alt-Harcourt has Harcourt Prime arrested…Thoughts From the Quantum Unfolding Chamber:Funny that Lex hasn’t even heard of Peacemaker.Was Lex permanently injured by Krypto’s attack in Superman, hence the cane? Or is he still healing? Will this lead to the power suit that’s already been teased by Gunn for Man of Tomorrow?Where’s Judomaster? He jumped over to the dimension last episode as well (unless he’s still wandering around the Quantum Unfolding Chamber). Then again, the Nazi planet probably isn’t too welcoming to him either…So in the preview for next week’s episode, who’s the prisoner who Lex referred Rick Sr. to?And what is Rick Sr.’s real plan? Could it be that he’s just trying to see his son once again, even if it's an alternate dimension version of him? That would certainly tie into the themes of the season nicely.",

      "content": "If you've ever stared down a stack of unplayed titles while adding more to cart anyway, welcome to my constant, salary-destroying conundrum. I keep telling myself I will clear the backlog, but when prices dip like this, resistance evaporates. Without further ado, let's just load you up with a mix of Nintendo classics, wild Xbox sales, PlayStation blockbusters, and a few PC gems that still command cult devotion.ContentsRetroNintendoXboxPlayStationPCPC GearLEGOThis Day in Gaming 🎂Today, I'm igniting 20 birthday candles (via an exploding Takedown crash) for Burnout Revenge, that high-octane racer that turned destruction into an art form. Sliding into PS2 and Xbox 360 garages back in 2005, it was the fourth entry in a series already famous for speed, but this one added traffic-checking (i.e., civilian cars can be shunted like empty Coke cans).The above was a weird change that I had to rewire my brain to appreciate. Otherwise, I have fond memories of slamming rivals into buses and watching the chaos ripple across intersections in glorious slow motion. This game still wasn't just about crossing the finish line; it was about humiliating one's opponents with \"polaroid snap\" Signature Kills. So much to love here.Aussie birthdays for notable games.- Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire (GBA) 2003. eBay- Soulcalibur II (GC,PS2,XB) 2003. eBay- Burnout Revenge (PS2,X360) 2005. eBayNice Savings for Nintendo SwitchOn Switch, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate offers timeless mayhem. I still remember Masahiro Sakurai saying he worked himself ill trying to make sure \"everyone is here,\" and it shows in the absurdly stacked roster. Meanwhile, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is proof lightning can strike twice. Its building system had me gluing rockets to minecarts just to see what would happen, and I always discovered something new.Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (-12%) - A$79 Samus is finally back, blasting aliens and scanning walls. Fans have waited ages, so strap in for some serious sci-fi spelunking.Super Smash Bros. Ult.

It’s the Final Fantasy that snuck in the back door and grew a cult following.Donkey Kong Country HD (-20%) - A$64 Barrel rolls, bananas, and brutal platforming. DK’s back to remind you just how bad you are at timing jumps.Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (-23%) - A$69 Build flying contraptions, solve puzzles, and yeet Koroks into oblivion.

SHODAN remains one of the best villains ever coded, smug as she berates your every move. Battlefield 2042, despite its rocky launch, has been patched into something closer to DICE's original chaos simulator, and few games deliver spectacle on that scale.Mafia: The Old Country (-23%) - A$69 Fancy a fedora and a Tommy gun? This mob tale mixes old school vendettas with double-crosses you’ll see coming a mile off.System Shock (-65%) - A$19 The original \"killer AI in space\" horror, rebooted and still terrifying. SHODAN will roast you harder than your internet mates.Crash Bandicoot 4: IAT (-43%) - A$57.20 Spin, die, repeat. Crash’s toughest outing is a nostalgia trip laced with controller-punching difficulty.Doom Eternal (-27%) - A$39.90 It’s metal album art come to life. Chainsaws, shotguns, and demons exploding into giblets never looked this good.Battlefield 2042 (-72%) - A$31.10 Go big or go home. 128-player chaos with tanks, jets, and the occasional broken parachute.Xbox OneDying Light 2: Stay Human (-81%) - A$19 Parkour by day, panic by night. Zombies get meaner when the sun sets, so keep your running shoes handy.Call of Duty: Vanguard (-74%) - A$28.40 World War II with slick graphics and twitchy multiplayer. The campaign’s short, but the bullets come fast.The Callisto Protocol (-62%) - A$32.40 Space prison, monsters, and a lot of stomping.

I lost hours just listening to Mimir while paddling.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 (-30%) - A$62.90 Kickflips and ska-punk nostalgia in glorious HD. Still the best way to break bones without insurance fees.Ghost of Yotei (-21%) - A$99 Samurai action with stunning landscapes and cinematic swordplay. A spiritual successor that feels mighty irresitible for this fan of Ghost of Tsushima.Mafia: The Old Country (-23%) - A$69 Crime, betrayal, and fast cars. Forget family dinners, this is the real mafia experience.Forza Horizon 5 (-50%) - A$49.90 An open-world car festival where you can race Lambos through deserts.

      "title": "Asus ROG Xbox Ally X – The Final Preview",
      "description": "",
      "content": "The ROG Xbox Ally consoles launch on October 16th, marking the first time that Microsoft has released an official gaming handheld – albeit in heavy cooperation with Asus, makers of the original ROG Ally devices. The new ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X promise unique hardware and software improvements and could be priced aggressively, but can they compete against the Steam Deck, Switch 2 and a growing field of handheld gaming PCs? Here's what we know so far, based on our hands-on testing at Gamescom and a host of official announcements. This is an Xbox – but not as you might expect. So what are they?To be clear, these aren't proper handheld Xboxes that will play any Xbox game, despite the \"this is an Xbox\" branding. However, they're still capable handheld gaming machines that can play a huge number of PC games natively, or stream Xbox games, either from an Xbox console or Microsoft's cloud streaming service. Compared to the old Ally devices, the new Xbox models have been spruced up with new AMD Z2 processors and a streamlined Windows operating system. That should translate into better performance and a step forward in usability, and could make these the best Steam Deck competitors so far.Two models with significantly different levels of performanceIt's worth knowing the difference between the two Xbox Ally models arriving in October: the Xbox Ally and the fancier Xbox Ally X.First up, the vanilla Xbox Ally offers Steam Deck level performance from its AMD Ryzen Z2 A chip, plus a higher-res screen, easier SSD upgradeability and wider game compatibility thanks to running Windows out of the box. However, the Steam Deck is available in an OLED model, is easier to drive given its lower 800p resolution, and runs the sleeker, often more performant Steam OS.The more interesting Xbox Ally X uses AMD's brand new Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chip, which promises the best performance we've seen in a PC gaming handheld, some exclusive Xbox features and more capable hardware. That could make it the device of choice for enthusiasts able to justify its high price – something we'll discuss later.How fast will the new handhelds be?So what will that performance difference look like? Looking at the hardware, the four Zen 2 cores and 8 RDNA 2 cores of the Xbox Ally ought to deliver roughly Steam Deck level performance at 15W, or a bit more at its maximum 20W TDP.Meanwhile, the Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme's eight Zen 5 cores and 16 RDNA 3.5 graphics cores should be significantly faster than the Steam Deck. Some early Z2 Extreme test results show a ballpark 15% performance advantage over the Z1 Extreme ROG Ally at maximum power. Interestingly, these results also show higher performance differentials at lower wattages, as well as lower power draw at matched frame-rates, suggesting that overall efficiency has improved.However, both Asus and Microsoft have said there's plenty of optimisation work to be done, so we'll need to wait for final hardware, software and drivers – and a chance to perform our own testing – before we can say anything definitive about performance.AI features coming in 2026 – for the Xbox Ally X only The Z2 Extreme also comes with dedicated AI hardware, with 50 TOPs of AI throughput, so what is it capable of? Out of the box, not much, but a few tantalising AI features are scheduled for 2026.The most interesting is Auto SR, an FSR1-like post-process upscaling that has a fixed latency cost. This was an impressive option when it debuted on Snapdragon X Windows laptops, and this will be the first time it's more widely available.Microsoft's marketing also notes a highlight reel feature, which promises to automatically generate clips of boss takedowns or multi-kills for social media.A thicker, comfier design with upgraded controls and impressive specsLet's talk about design. First, the vanilla Xbox Ally has a white shell, while the Xbox Ally X comes in black. Despite their varying capabilities, both Xbox Ally models are the same size, at 291 x 122 x 51mm, with a thicker design than the OG ROG Ally. That allows for proper Xbox-style controls and a comfier grip. Both models come with the same seven-inch 1080p 120Hz VRR LCD display as the original ROG Ally too.The Xbox Ally X is 45g heavier than the standard Xbox Ally. A lot of that is due to a battery upgrade, from 60 watt hours to 80 watt hours, and the inclusion of dual-motor Impulse triggers. The X also upgrades one of the two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports on the vanilla model to USB 4, unlocking full speed access to DisplayPort 2.1 and Thunderbolt 4 devices – including external graphics cards.Inside, the vanilla model gets 512GB of storage and 16GB of 6400MT/s RAM, while the X gets 1TB of storage and 24GB of 8000MT/s RAM. Both models use large M.2 2280 SSDs for easy upgradeability, rather than the smaller 2230 standard used on the original ROG Ally and Steam Deck. Finally, both devices come with a 65W charger and a stand in the box.What we said about the original Asus ROG Ally XThe Asus ROG Ally X is simply the best handheld gaming PC on the market right now. With more and faster memory and double the battery as the original Ally, the Ally X will run any modern game without dying in an hour and a half. – Jacqueline Thomas, Jul 21, 2024 Score: 9Read the full Asus ROG Ally X review.A redesigned interface, a wider launcher and more software updatesAs well as some promising hardware, the Xbox Ally uses a new \"Xbox Full Screen Experience\" that promises a more gamepad-friendly interface and better performance than prior Windows gaming handhelds. For example, you can log in using the gamepad, rather than needing to enter your PIN via touch or use a fingerprint reader, which loads you into a full-screen Xbox app. Gamepad controls should work everywhere here, and you can hold down the dedicated Xbox button to quickly swap between games and apps or close them. There are also phone-style touch gestures to access the Game Bar or change apps.The core Xbox app has seen some key improvements, including new library features that automatically bring in games from other launchers like Steam or GOG – though you'll need to actually install these games in the desktop Windows mode. However, once installed, you can see all of your games in the same place.Microsoft is also debuting an evolution on the Steam Deck Verified idea, with separate ratings for handheld optimisation and performance. The Handheld Optimised badge indicates a game that has a suitable interface and gamepad controls, while the Windows Performance Fit shows whether it'll run in excess of 30 or 60fps on your device. There's even a Gaming Copilot that you should be able to ask for tips to progress in-game, or check your achievement progress, with the AI receiving a screenshot of your current game to help you. If you've used an ROG Ally handheld before, you'll be familiar with the Asus Armoury Crate app. This software will still be used for changing performance profiles, showing overlays and so on.And while Microsoft imagines that you'll spend most of your time in the new handheld-optimised mode, you can still access a full version of Windows 11, which spools up services like the desktop window manager that don't start in the default gaming mode. Afterwards, you can reboot to ensure you're getting full performance, or go straight back into the gaming UI if you're expecting to dip back and forth a few times.Hands-on impressions from GamescomSo how does the Xbox Ally actually play? Based on our hands-on time at Gamescom, both machines feel capable. They sport the same bright and responsive LCD display as the original Xbox Ally, but with improved ergonomics that are more in line with the Steam Deck than the Switch 2. The new user experience felt a little buggy, requiring a reboot on our first tester unit, but the improved launcher, touch gestures and fast game switching felt good and saved time. With their Windows performance optimisations, plus extra power under the hood on Xbox Ally X, these could be some of the most capable gaming handhelds on the market… but we'll have to wait for final hardware and software before rendering a verdict.Official Xbox Ally pricing has finally been announcedMicrosoft has confirmed that the lower-end Xbox Ally will retail for $599, while the full-fat Xbox Ally X will cost $999. In the UK, the Ally X will cost £799, while the Ally will cost £499. The EU reference prices are similar, at €899 and €599.These prices suggest the Xbox Ally could be a shade cheaper than other Z2 Extreme-powered handhelds, like the MSI Claw A8 at £850 (about $1160) or the Lenovo Legion Go 2 at $1350, but still painful compared to, say, $650 for the most expensive Steam Deck. As gaming gets even more expensive across the board, this handheld Xbox is a pricey privilege, no doubt. For its part, Microsoft is doubtlessly incentivized to keep prices as low as possible, in order to reap Game Pass subscriptions and game sales from a wider install base, but Asus is also looking to justify its long investment into PC handhelds – and create meaningful separation from its existing ROG Ally models. Ultimately, the value question comes down to the quality of the software and the strength of the silicon, both of which are still unknown quantities.Can Microsoft's secret sauce elevate the Xbox Ally consoles above other PC handhelds?It feels like the Xbox Ally handhelds were originally pitched as offering both unique hardware and software, but consumers will be able to pick up other Z2 Extreme handhelds from MSI and Lenovo around the same time – though the Xbox-style controls remain unique. The unique software promise is time-limited too, as Microsoft has said that its handheld optimisations will arrive on other PC handhelds, and the revised launcher is already available on existing devices.Regardless, the Xbox Ally and Ally X could be the best value PC gaming handhelds at their respective price points, and it'll be fascinating to see whether Microsoft's console expertise pushes them to the top of what is an increasingly competitive field.",

      "title": "ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally Price Finally Revealed — Microsoft Goes for $1,000 for Most Powerful Version Amid Tariff Uncertainty",
      "description": "",
      "content": "Microsoft has confirmed the price of the ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally ahead of the release of both handheld gaming PCs on October 16.The company has gone for $999.99 for the more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X, and $599.99 for the ROG Xbox Ally.The pricing announcement comes in hot from Microsoft, with just a few weeks to go until the handhelds launch. At gamescom in August, Microsoft and Asus told IGN the companies still needed \"more time to figure out the macro-economic impact to pricing,” a statement issued amid frequently shifting market conditions fuelled by ever-changing U.S. tariffs.\"This is always a challenge,\" Jason Ronald, Microsoft's vice president of Xbox gaming devices and ecosystem, told IGN last month, \"and you always try to find the right balance between affordability and price point, and I think especially in a mobile form factor that also adds in dimensions such as battery life in as well. And then, as you said, the macro-economic climate is challenging.\"\"I think we will have to... we need more time to figure the macro-economic impact to pricing, and that's why we'll be sharing more later, in September and October,\" Asus senior vice president Shawn Yen added.As part of the same interview, we also asked Ronald about Microsoft's internal plans to make a first-party Xbox handheld, following a report that suggested the idea had been sidelined.The ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally launch into an increasingly competitive market for handheld gaming hardware, with the cheaper Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch 2 now firmly entrenched. Meanwhile, Microsoft has come under fire for repeatedly hiking the price of its Xbox hardware. Just last week, Microsoft announced that Xbox console prices would go up once again in the U.S. after already rising back in May.Microsoft said the Xbox console price increases occurred \"due to changes in the macro-economic environment,\" and added that in the future, it would \"continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and providing value for Xbox players.”This move comes as many video game companies are raising prices on everything from consoles to accessories to games, with price hikes affecting the U.S. in particular amid ongoing tariff fluctuation and uncertainty. Last month, Sony implemented a price increase in the U.S. on its hardware, and after releasing its Nintendo Switch 2 at $450, Nintendo raised the price on its original Switch 1 and various accessories as well. Video games and subscriptions are being impacted: Xbox raised its prices for Game Pass earlier this year, Mario Kart Tour launched at an unheard-of $80, and Xbox announced it would also introduce $80 games this holiday, though it backtracked on that decision shortly after.We've previously spoken to expert analysts about the rising prices of all gaming items, and they explained that the increases are likely occurring due to a mixture of increased manufacturing costs, competition, and U.S. tariffs, with the latter particular relevant in cases where prices are climbing in the U.S. and nowhere else.The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) has issued statements on the impact of tariffs in the U.S., with ESA spokesperson Aubrey Quinn telling IGN in April: \"There's going to be a real impact regardless of company. This is company-agnostic, this is an entire industry. There's going to be an impact on the entire industry.”ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally prices globally:ROG Xbox Ally X: $999.99 / £799 / €899 (ERP) / $1599 AUD (ERP)ROG Xbox Ally: $599.99 / £499 / €599 (ERP) / $999 AUD (ERP)Alongside its pricing announcement, Microsoft has opened up pre-orders for both the ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally through the Microsoft Store, ASUS eshop, and select global retailers in 38 countries.Here’s the official blurb on the ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally from Microsoft:One of our core goals with the Xbox Ally was to deliver a distinctly Xbox experience in the palm of your hands.

      "description": "",
      "content": "I'm fairly new to the world of adult LEGO. I'd built my fair share of creations with these tiny plastic bricks when I was a kid, but at some point I just stopped playing with LEGO and didn't think I'd ever really go back. Then just earlier this year I managed to convince myself to buy the LEGO Piranha Plant.As a long-time fan of Nintendo, the experience was an absolute delight. The pieces were unique and the build itself was just challenging enough to provide hours of concentrated enjoyment. And now that it's actually put together, this little chompy guy from the Super Mario universe gets to sit next to me on my desk every day.There are a ton of other awesome LEGO Nintendo sets you can buy, but this particular one is just the right mix of affordable and fun, in my opinion. It's been discounted below $50 at most major retailers for a while now, but Target has recently included a unique offer that also gets you a free trial of Nintendo Switch Online.LEGO Piranha Plant Deal at TargetThe actual retail price of the Piranha Plant set is $59.99, which is what you'd pay if you bought it directly from the LEGO Store. However, it's been discounted at other retailers. According to CamelCamelCamel, the price dropped down to $47.99 back in October of last year and has pretty much remained there since. So while this discount at Target is nice, it isn't anything new. What is new, is you can now get a 14-day free trial of Nintendo Switch Online with your purchase. To redeem the offer you'll need to be a Target Circle member, which is free to join.Nintendo offers its own free trial for Switch Online memberships, but it only lasts a total of seven days. So really what you'd be getting here is an extra week to try it out to see if you like it. While it certainly isn't the greatest deal in the world, it does make Target the best place to buy the Piranha Plant set right now. If you're already planning on picking one up, you might as well scoop up a free trial while you're at it. I own this LEGO set and have a subscription to Nintendo Switch Online and confirm that both of those things are totally worth the money.More LEGO Sets on Sale at TargetIf you're looking for more discounts on popular LEGO sets, the good news is that Target is currently having a sale on a bunch of them. From now until September 27 you can get 15% off several sets that have rarely been discounted prior. This sale includes the upcoming Gizmo set and the iconic Hocus Pocus cottage, just in time for spooky season.Jacob Kienlen is a Senior SEO Strategist and Writer for IGN.

As part of a limited time Lighting Deal, Amazon has discounted the Anker Prime 6-Port 200W USB Desktop Charging Station to just $55.99. This charger features both USB Type-A and Type-C ports and can deliver as much as 100W of power per port. Anker is also one of the most trusted brands on Amazon when it comes to reliability.Anker Prime 6-Port 200W USB Desktop ChargerThe Anker Prime charging station features six total ports: two USB Type-A ports and four USB Type-C ports. Each Type-C port can deliver up to 100W and each Type-A port can deliver up to 22.5W. All six ports can be used simultaneously, however charging caps at 200W. The 100W port is powerful enough to charge laptops, tablets, and power hungry gaming handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally X, Steam Deck, or Lenovo Legion Go. The 22.5W ports can handle gaming or PC peripherals like mice, headsets, controllers, and so forth. It can even charge the Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 at their fastest rate (neither consume more than 20W in handheld mode) if your Type-C ports are all used up.Other practical features include GaN technology (smaller footprint and increased energy efficiency), a heavyset base so that it won't slide around on your desk, and multiple protection protocols. Unlike most charging stations from overseas brands, this model is both UL and CB certified. It comes with a 24-month Anker warranty.Looking for more options?

      "description": "",
      "content": "Starting now and running through September 28, Walmart is hosting an exclusive \"GeForce Week\" sale with some astoundingly good deals on prebuilt gaming PCs featuring Nvidia's new GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs. These deals are, frankly, so good that they're worth picking up before Black Friday. This sale appears to be run by Walmart so you probably won't find these deals anywhere else (unless another retailer price matches). Prices on Nvidia GPUs have finally started trending downwards, and it's great to see that it's also having an effect on prebuilt gaming PCs as well.Walmart GeForce Week: The Best Gaming PC DealsTrending dealsAcer Nitro 60 AMD Ryzen 9 7900 RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC for $1,499Acer Nitro 60 AMD Ryzen 7 7700 RTX 5070 Gaming PC for $1,099iBuypower Element Pro AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D RTX 5070 Gaming PC for $1,199Read on for more details. I've broken down the deals by graphics card, since that is the one of the biggest dictators of price. If you haven't yet done your research and aren't sure which level of PC is right for you, I'd suggest starting with the GPU (check out our GPU guide) and seeing which option below matches the resolution of your display and the type of game you intend to play. Games like Hollow Knight: Silksong are far less taxing on your PC than, say, Battlefield 6.RTX 5090 Prebuilt Gaming PC DealsRead our Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 reviewLet's start with the highest end gaming PCs first and move down from there. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 has emerged as the most powerful consumer GPU on the market. Although with this generation Nvidia has prioritized software updates, AI features, and DLSS 4 technology to improve gameplay performance, the 5090 still boasts an impressive 25%-30% uplift over the RTX 4090 in hardware-based raster performance. If you want the absolute best performance for your gaming PC, there is literally no other option from any other brand.RTX 5080 Prebuilt Gaming PC DealsRead our Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 reviewPerformance-wise, the RTX 5080 is no slouch. It's one of the fastest cards on the market, bested only by the $2,000 RTX 5090 and the discontinued $1,600 RTX 4090. This is a phenomenal card for playing the latest, most demanding games in 4K resolution at high settings and ray tracing enabled and you'll save well over $1,000 by picking this over the 5090.RTX 5070 Ti Prebuilt Gaming PC DealsRead out Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti reviewThe RTX 5070 Ti is considered by many to be the most affordable of the high-end GPUs. If you're looking to play games in 4K resolution at 60+ framerates, then the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and is only about 10%-15% behind the RTX 5080, which may be a worthy tradeoff in order to save $400 compared to an RTX 5080 prebuilt. The RTX 5070 Ti also has 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM just like the 5080.RTX 5070 Prebuilt Gaming PC DealsRead our Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 reviewCompared to the previous generation GPUs, the RTX 5070 performs a bit better than the RTX 4070 Super. I wish there was a bigger generation improvement in raw performance, but the RTX 5070 is still a superior graphics card because it supports DLSS 4 and has 12GB of the newer GDDR7 VRAM on top of the slight performance improvement. You probably won't even find an RTX 4070 Super gaming PC for less than $1,100, either. The RTX 5070 is a popular GPU for 1080p or 1440 gaming. The next card up - the RTX 5070 Ti - is significantly more expensive and really for gamers who want high fps 1440p or 4K gaming. Anything less demanding and it's probably overkill.RTX 5060 Prebuilt Gaming PC DealsRead our Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 reviewThe RTX 5060 performs about 15% better than the RTX 4060 that is replaces. It will run most games in 1080p at framerates of up to 60fps, although some games might require some settings adjustments. 1440p is a viable option too, although you will see an improvement bumping up to a 5060 Ti or 5070 at that point. Like all Blackwell GPUs, the RTX 5060 supports DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation, and the performance improvement over the 4060 will be bigger with games that support it.Why are some people disappointed by Nvidia's Blackwell cards?A lot of people have beef with Nvidia's new graphics cards, but it's not specifically about the product itself. The problem is with the rather lackluster generational improvement over the 40 series cards and the fact that these cards used to be tremendously marked up. If you're coming from an RTX 30 series card or older, or you're upgrading from a lower end GPU to a higher end one, then an RTX 50 series card is still one of your best options. RTX 40 series cards, however close in performance to the RTX 50 series they may be, are not readily sourceable, unless you want to take a risk buying a used one off without warranty on eBay or Facebook Marketplace. AMD cards, although a better value on paper, are still marked up in price (i.e. the $599 RTX 9070 XT is about $700 on Amazon).How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.

      "content": "Multiple whistleblowers alleged that DOGE uploaded a highly sensitive Social Security Administration (SSA) database to an unmonitored cloud environment, according to a report by Senate Democratic staff. The staff report describes an investigation into DOGE activities at three agencies, including a site visit at the General Services Administration (GSA) in which DOGE officials appeared to be hiding certain areas from view. As we reported last month, then-SSA Chief Data Officer Chuck Borges alleged that DOGE officials created \"a live copy of the country's Social Security information in a cloud environment that circumvents oversight.\" At least one other whistleblower has apparently made the same allegation. Whistleblowers, including Borges, alleged \"that Edward Coristine, the 19-year-old DOGE staffer who was previously fired from a job for leaking company data to a competitor, and other DOGE personnel had been granted permission to move highly sensitive SSA data into an unmonitored cloud environment,\" the Senate Democratic report said. \"The whistleblowers said that DOGE has uploaded a live copy of NUMIDENT, which contains highly sensitive personal data on anyone who has held a social security number, including every American. This includes social security numbers (SSNs), place and date of birth, work permit status, and parents' names, among other sensitive personal information, for all Americans, to a cloud environment.\"Read full article Comments",

On Thursday, NASA, confirming an earlier Ars Technica report, said the first flight of the winged spacecraft will no longer berth with the International Space Station. Rather, the space agency said, the Dream Chaser program would be \"best served\" by a free flight demonstration. \"Development of new space transportation systems is difficult and can take longer than what’s originally planned,\" said Dana Weigel, manager of NASA's International Space Station Program, in a news release. \"As NASA and its partners look toward space station deorbit in 2030, this mutually agreed to decision enables testing and verification to continue on Dream Chaser, as well as demonstrating the capabilities of the spaceplane for future resupply missions in low Earth orbit.\"Read full article Comments",

      "description": "",
      "content": "4 min readPreparations for Next Moonwalk Simulations Underway (and Underwater) Recent airborne science flights to Greenland are improving NASA’s understanding of space weather by measuring radiation exposure to air travelers and validating global radiation maps used in flight path planning. This unique data also has value beyond the Earth as a celestial roadmap for using the same instrumentation to monitor radiation levels for travelers entering Mars’ atmosphere and for upcoming lunar exploration. NASA’s Space Weather Aviation Radiation (SWXRAD) aircraft flight campaign took place August 25-28 and conducted two five-hour flights in Nuuk, Greenland. Based out of NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, the mission gathered dosimetry measurements, or the radiation dose level, to air travelers from cosmic radiation. Cosmic radiation is caused by high-energy particles from outer space that originate from our Sun during eruptive events like solar flares and from events farther away, like supernovae in our Milky Way galaxy and beyond. Science team partners from Honeywell reviewing dosimeter data on board NASA’s B200 King Air during a flight over Nuuk, Greenland. NASA/Guillaume Gronoff \"With NASA spacecraft and astronauts exploring the Moon, Mars, and beyond, we support critical research to understand – and ultimately predict – the impacts of space weather across the solar system,” said Jamie Favors, director of NASA’s Space Weather Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “Though this project is focused on aviation applications on Earth, NAIRAS could be part of the next generation of tools supporting Artemis missions to the Moon and eventually human missions to Mars.\" Jamie Favors, NASA Space Weather Program director, and Chris Mertens, SWXRAD principal investigator, discussing a dosimeter at NASA’s Langley Research Center as specialized instruments are integrated onto NASA’s B200 King Air aircraft before deploying to Greenland.NASA/Mark Knopp NASA’s Nowcast of Aerospace Ionizing Radiation System, or NAIRAS, is the modeling system being enhanced by the SWXRAD airborne science flights. The model features real-time global maps of the hazardous radiation in the atmosphere and creates exposure predictions for aircraft and spacecraft. NASA’s B200 King Air on the runway in Goose Bay, Canada, a stop during the flight to Nuuk, Greenland.NASA/Guillaume Gronoff “The radiation exposure is maximum at the poles and minimum at the equator because of the effect of Earth's magnetic field. In the polar regions, the magnetic field lines are directed into or out of the Earth, so there's no deflection or shielding by the fields of the radiation environment that you see everywhere else.” explained Chris Mertens, principal investigator of SWXRAD at NASA Langley. “Greenland is a region where the shielding of cosmic radiation by Earth's magnetic field is zero.” That means flight crews and travelers on polar flights from the U.S. to Asia or from the U.S. to Europe are exposed to higher levels of radiation. Frozen and rocky terrain in the Polar region observed from above Nuuk, Greenland during NASA’s SWXRAD science flights.NASA/Guillaume Gronoff The data gathered in Greenland will be compared to the NAIRAS modeling, which bases its computation on sources around the globe that include neutron monitors and instruments that measure solar wind parameters and the magnetic field along with spaceborne data from instruments like the NOAA GOES series of satellites. “If the new data doesn't agree, we have to go back and look at why that is,” said Mertens. “In the radiation environment, one of the biggest uncertainties is the effect of Earth’s magnetic field. So, this mission eliminates that variable in the model and enables us to concentrate on other areas, like characterizing the particles that are coming in from space into the atmosphere, and then the transport and interactions with the atmosphere.” An aerial view of Nuuk, Greenland.NASA/Guillaume Gronoff The SWXRAD science team flew aboard NASA’s B200 King Air with five researchers and crew members. In the coming months, the team will focus on measurement data quality checks, quantitative modeling comparisons, and a validation study between current NAIRAS data and the new aircraft dosimeter measurements. All of this information is endeavoring to protect pilots and passengers on Earth from the health risks associated with radiation exposure while using NASA’s existing science capabilities to safely bring astronauts to the Moon and Mars. Northern Lights, or auroras, seen over the city of Nuuk, Greenland. Auroras are considered space weather and are easily visible effects of activity from the Sun interacting with the magnetosphere and Earth’s atmosphere.NASA/Guillaume Gronoff “Once you get to Mars and even the transit out to Mars, there would be times where we don't have any data sets to really understand what the environment is out there,” said Favors. “So we're starting to think about not only how do we get ready for those humans on Mars, but also what data do we need to bring with them? So we're feeding this data into models exactly like NAIRAS. This model is thinking about Mars in the same way it’s thinking about Earth.” The SWXRAD flight mission is funded through NASA’s Science Mission Directorate Heliophysics Division. NASA’s Space Weather Program Office is hosted at NASA Langley and facilitates researchers in the creation of new tools to predict space weather and to understand space weather effects on Earth’s infrastructure, technology, and society.

      "description": "",
      "content": "After the posting—and apparent editing—of a job opening spotted this week, it's expected that Amazon will bring its homegrown operating system to Fire TV devices this year. Most of Amazon’s Fire-branded devices, which include tablets, currently run some version of Fire OS, which is an Android fork based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). For years, Fire OS’s reliance on AOSP has resulted in Amazon devices coming out with older software, such as 2024’s Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet, which came out with Fire OS 8, which is based on 2020’s Android 11. Some devices already run Amazon’s proprietary software, reportedly codenamed Vega OS. The current Echo Hub smart home control panel, Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) smart home display, and Echo Spot smart speaker all run an OS based on the Linux 5.16 kernel, per details in Amazon’s source code notice for Alexa devices. However, Amazon has never publicly acknowledged that the OS exists.Read full article Comments",

      "description": "",
      "content": "Amazon MGM Studios announced Thursday that Spaceballs 2, the long-awaited sequel to the 1987 sci-fi comedy and Star Wars parody, is now in production. The studio also released a behind-the-scenes photo of the cast doing a table read of the screenplay (seen below), which is a send-up of the Star Wars: The Force Awakens cast table read photo from 2014. You can see the two photos below.The studio also confirmed that Rick Moranis has officially returned to acting to reprise his role as Dark Helmet in Spaceballs 2. Technically, Spaceballs 2 isn’t the first time Moranis has reprised the role of Pannakin Crybaby /Lord Dark Helmet. He voiced the character in an episode of The Goldbergs in 2018.Moranis gradually withdrew from public life following his wife’s death in 1991, prioritizing raising his children over his acting career. Although he clarified in a 2015 interview that he had not actually retired from acting and was just being “picky” about his projects – turning down the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot – Moranis has been on an extended hiatus from the screen since 1997 when he starred in Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves.In the years since, Moranis has done voice roles in Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys, the Brother Bear movies, and Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Kids. He reunited with his Strange Brew co-star and fellow SCTV alum Dave Thomas for Bob & Doug McKenzie's Two-Four Anniversary in 2007. Moranis also famously appeared opposite fellow Canadian Ryan Reynolds in a Mint Mobile commercial in 2020.In his Hollywood heyday in the 1980s and ‘90s, Moranis appeared in such films as Ghostbusters (and its first sequel), Little Shop of Horrors, The Flintstones, Parenthood, L.A. Story, Streets of Fire, Little Giants, Big Bully, and, of course, the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids franchise.Moranis isn’t the only cast member from Spaceballs to return for the sequel. Mel Brooks, Daphne Zuniga and Bill Pullman as Yogurt, Princess Vespa, and Lone Starr, respectively. Pullman’s son, Thunderbolts' Lewis Pullman is also in the film.The cast of Spaceballs 2 also includes Josh Gad, Keke Palmer, Anthony Carrigan, George and Wyner. Gad, Palmer, Lewis Pullman, and Carrigan will play brand-new characters.Josh Greenbaum (Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar) is directing from a script by Benji Samit and Dan Hernandez (Lego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy; TMNT: Mutant Mayhem), and Josh Gad. Imagine Entertainment’s Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, and Jeb Brody are producing the film, alongside Mel Brooks, Josh Gad, Josh Greenbaum, and Kevin Salter. Adam Merims, Benji Samit, and Dan Hernandez will executive produce.Spaceballs 2 will open in theaters in 2027.",

      "title": "The Best Anime Streaming Services in 2025",
      "description": "",
      "content": "With so many different streaming services available, there are a lot of different places to watch movies and TV shows online. The sheer amount of options can make it difficult to find exactly what you're looking for, especially for anime with some major titles split up between multiple services.If you're wondering where you can watch anime online in 2025, we've gathered some of the best sites and apps below. While some streaming services offer a full suite of options, others have only a smaller selection. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to watch the best anime online across various subscriptions, and some are super cheap or even free.CrunchyrollBest Anime Streaming Service OverallIf you're looking for the absolute best overall anime streaming service, Crunchyroll is the way to go. With an enormous catalog of anime movies and series, the anime-focused streaming service is your best bet if you're looking for a lot of options. They also offer new episodes of many popular anime series shortly after they air in Japan. Whether you're looking to watch the classics or watch new episodes of anime like the upcoming final season of My Hero Academia, Crunchyroll can provide that with a subscription.Crunchyroll has three different tiers of their service that all offer streaming their full anime library without ads. They also offer a seven-day free trial for newcomers to test out the service, but the cheapest plan starts out at $7.99 a month after that. Crunchyroll does offer some anime for free with ads, regardless of your subscription tier, including Chainsaw Man and My Hero Academia. The most expensive tier of the service will get you additional perks like discounts at the Crunchyroll Store and access to their game vault.Anime Recommendations on Crunchyroll: TubiBest Free Anime Streaming ServiceIf you're looking for the best place to watch anime for free, Tubi is a surprisingly great option. Supported by ads, Tubi offers a selection of anime that includes Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Naruto, and various other popular franchises. They also have an enormous selection of classics and new anime to choose from in their catalog, all of which does not cost a dime. You can check out the full list of anime on Tubi to see what they have available.Tubi doesn't require a monthly subscription to start streaming content, but you do need to register. You can create an account using your email or simply use your Google account to sign in. Tubi also offers free films and TV shows from a variety of other genres, making it one of the best free movie sites available.Anime Recommendations on Tubi: HIDIVE Best Cheap Anime Streaming ServiceIf you're looking for something more robust than a free streaming service, but without coughing up your life savings for something Crunchyroll, you might enjoy a compromise like HIDIVE. The service has a single subscription tier that costs $6.99/month or $69.99/year, which gives you access to full series like Nana, No Game No Life, and Food Wars!. The site is also the exclusive streaming home for series like Made in Abyss, and regularly hosts simulcasts (you can check the current schedule here). In my opinion, this is also a solid place to find hidden gems you might not come across on something more mainstream. Anime Recommendations on HIDIVE: HuluBest All-in-One Streaming ServiceAlthough Hulu isn't necessarily the best site for watching anime online, it does offer the unique advantage of being more than just for anime. A Hulu subscription can get you access to a huge variety of movies, shows, and anime all at once. While the service doesn't have quite the depth you'd get with Crunchyroll, they do offer popular anime series (both subbed and dubbed) like Dragon Ball, Attack on Titan, and Naruto. They also have the latest episodes of Spy x Family and Chainsaw Man if you're looking for something fresh. You can check out the full catalog of anime on Hulu for more details about what the service can offer. Hulu has 2 different plans to choose from: No ads for $18.99 a month or with ads for $9.99 a month (raising to $11.99/month on October 21). Aside from standalone plans, Hulu is also available in plenty of streaming bundles, which I'd definitely recommend in light of news that Hulu will be merging into Disney+ next year. Anime Recommendations on Hulu: NetflixBest for New Original AnimeNetflix is the biggest streaming service/app in the world, so it should be of no surprise that it has a pretty decent selection of anime. They have One Piece, Hunter x Hunter, Demon Slayer, and even a few Pokemon movies. However, the real draw of Netflix for anime fans is that they have originals that are actually pretty good. There are some great original films like Bubble as well as video game adaptations like Tekken: Bloodline. You can check out our guide to the best anime on Netflix for our top picks.Although Netflix is currently going through some changes in it's subscription system, the ad-supported plan is currently $7.99 a month. The standard and premium subscriptions are more expensive, but add the ability to download Netflix movies for offline viewing.Anime Recommendations on Netflix: HBO MaxBest Streaming Service for Anime MoviesNow that HBO Max is back to the original name, it's a lot harder to find what their selection of anime even is. That being said, HBO Max does have all of the Studio Ghibli movies available to stream, making them worthy of note on this list. More recently, HBO Max signed a new deal with GKIDS, giving the streaming service rights to some previously hard-to-find movies from directors like Makoto Shinkai and Hideaki Anno. HBO Max is also where you'll find anime picked up for American distribution by Adult Swim, like the new anime from the creator of Cowboy Bebop, Lazarus. HBO Max has three different tiers of their subscription service starting at $9.99 for their ad-supported option.Anime Recommendations on Max: Anime Streaming Sites FAQWhat are the best sites to watch anime for free? Aside from Tubi and the limited selection of free anime on Crunchyroll, there's a few more sites where you can stream anime for free. RetroCrush offers a wide selection of \"vintage\" anime and cartoons, including the original Astro Boy, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and City Hunter series. Sling TV's FreeStream program also includes several anime channels with on demand series like Fruits Basket, Maid-Sama, and Ghost Stories. How can I watch anime live in the U.S.?Most anime airs live in Japan before becoming available to stream in the United States. Crunchyroll's licensing deals allow the service to stream new episodes typically within a day of their original airtime, which is part of the reason why its the best streaming service for anime overall. With a couple of exceptions for exclusives, even anime that eventually comes to Netflix or Hulu typically arrives on Crunchyroll way beforehand. If there's a new episode or special coming up that you really want to watch live, you'll most likely have to sign up for a VPN to get access to local Japanese channels like FujiTV.

      "description": "",
      "content": "Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards are dropping in price, and fortunately that means prebuilt gaming PCs are becoming more affordable too. As part of a Walmart exclusive GeForce Week event that runs through September 28, three RTX 5070 Ti equipped gaming PCs are marked down to the lowest prices I've seen all year long. Of the three, the best dea is the Acer Nitro 60 gaming PC for just $1,499 with free delivery. It pairs the RTX 5070 Ti GPU with a powerful AMD Ryzen 9 7900 CPU and a generous amount of RAM and SSD storage out of the box.The RTX 5070 Ti GPU Has Excellent 4K Gaming PerformanceOf all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. Like all Blackwell cards, the RTX 5070 Ti supports DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation. This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution. If you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti may be a better value than the 5080 since it has the same amount of VRAM.

These deals are, frankly, so good that they're worth picking up before Black Friday. This sale appears to be run by Walmart so you probably won't find these deals anywhere else (unless another retailer price matches).

      "description": "",
      "content": "On Thursday, OpenAI announced ChatGPT Pulse, a new \"push\" feature that generates personalized daily updates for users without having to ask each time. The preview feature, available now for Pro subscribers on mobile, marks OpenAI's latest attempt to make ChatGPT proactive rather than reactive, with the AI model conducting overnight research to deliver morning updates based on user history and connected apps. OpenAI calls it \"personalized research and timely updates that appear regularly to keep you informed.\" ChatGPT Pulse works by analyzing a user's chat history, saved preferences, and optional connections to Gmail and Google Calendar each night. The next morning, users receive visual \"cards\" (small illustrated squares with topic summaries that can be expanded for detail) containing updates on topics the model determines are relevant, such as project follow-ups, dinner suggestions, or travel recommendations. Users can provide feedback through thumbs up or down ratings and request specific topics through a \"curate\" button. OpenAI says that rather than waiting for users to initiate conversations, ChatGPT now attempts to deliver information preemptively using what OpenAI calls \"asynchronous research,\" essentially having the model generate queries and responses overnight using traditional methods. Updates appear once daily and disappear after 24 hours unless users save them or ask follow-up questions, which converts them into standard chat conversations.Read full article Comments",

      "description": "",
      "content": "The proposed federal budget would see drastic cuts made to most of the agencies that fund science. The sheer magnitude of the cuts—including a 40 percent slashing of money going to the National Institutes of Health—would do severe harm to biomedical researchers and the industries that serve or rely on them. And, ultimately, that is likely to do harm to all of us. In today's issue of Science, some researchers have attempted to put numbers on those indirect effects that fall within that \"ultimately\" category. They've identified which grants wouldn't have been funded had similar cuts been made earlier in this century and tracked the impact that likely had on drug patents. Their conclusion: Development of roughly half the newly approved drugs relied on work that was funded by a grant that would need to be cut. From grants to drugs It's uncertain whether the proposed budget cuts will go through. At the moment, Congress is looking to fund most science agencies at levels similar to their current budgets. Should cuts eventually happen, then it's also difficult to predict how they'll be spread among the more than 20 institutes that make up the NIH (a number that the administration also wants to see reduced via consolidation). So, the researchers make a big simplifying assumption: Every institute within the NIH will take a 40 percent hit to its budget.Read full article Comments",

In fact, at least 1 in 10 retail investors now consult ChatGPT or other AI chatbots for stock-picking advice, according to a Reuters report published Thursday. Data from a survey by trading platform eToro of 11,000 retail investors worldwide suggests that 13 percent of individual investors already use AI tools like ChatGPT or Google's Gemini for stock selection, while about half say they would consider using these tools for portfolio decisions. Unlike algorithmic trading, where computers automatically execute thousands of trades per second, investors are using ChatGPT as an advisory tool in place of human experts. They type questions, read the AI model's analysis, and then manually decide whether to place trades through their brokers.Read full article Comments",

      "content": "3 Min Read NASA Opens 2026 Human Lander Challenge for Life Support Systems, More NASA’s 2026 Human Lander Challenge is seeking ideas from college and university students to help evolve and transform technologies for life support and environmental control systems. These systems are critical for sustainable, long-duration human spaceflight missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. The Human Lander Challenge supports NASA’s efforts to foster innovative solutions to a variety of areas for NASA’s long-duration human spaceflight plans at the Moon under the Artemis campaign. The Human Lander Challenge is sponsored by the Human Landing System Program within the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate. The 2026 competition invites undergraduate and graduate-level teams based in the U.S., along with their faculty advisors, to develop innovative, systems-level solutions to improve aspects for a lander’s ECLSS (Environmental Control and Life Support System) performance. These air, water, and waste systems provide vital life support so future Artemis astronauts can live and work safely and effectively on the Moon during crewed missions. Each proposed solution should focus on one of the following long-duration ECLSS subtopics: Noise suppression and control Sensor reduction in hardware health monitoring systems Potable water dispenser Fluid transfer between surface assets on the Moon and Mars “A robust ECLSS transforms a spacecraft like a lander from just hardware into a livable environment, providing breathable air, clean water, and safe conditions for astronauts as they explore the Moon,” said Kevin Gutierrez, acting office manager for the Human Landing Systems Missions Systems Management Office at NASA Marshall. “Without ECLSS we can’t sustain human presence on the Moon or take the next steps toward Mars. The subtopics in the 2026 Human Lander Challenge reflect opportunities for students to support the future of human spaceflight.” 2026 Competition Teams should submit a non-binding notice of intent by Monday, Oct. 20, if they intend to participate. Proposal packages are due March 4, 2026. Based on proposal package evaluations in Phase 1, up to 12 finalist teams will be selected to receive a $9,000 stipend and advance to Phase 2 of the competition, which includes a final design review near NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, June 23-25, 2026. The top three placing teams from Phase 2 will share a total prize of $18,000. Landers are in development by SpaceX and Blue Origin as transportation systems that will safely ferry astronauts from lunar orbit to the Moon’s surface and back for the agency’s Artemis campaign. NASA Marshall manages the Human Landing System Program. The challenge is administered by the National Institute of Aerospace on behalf of the agency. Through the agency’s Artemis campaign, NASA will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and to build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars – for the benefit of all.

      "description": "",
      "content": "The Sierra Space Dream Chaser winged spacecraft is seen stacked atop its Shooting Star cargo module on the vibration table at NASA’s Armstrong Test Facility in Sandusky, Ohio, while undergoing testing to simulate launch and re-entry conditions.NASA In 2016, NASA awarded a Commercial Resupply Services-2 contract to Sierra Space, formerly part of Sierra Nevada Corporation, to resupply the International Space Station with its Dream Chaser spaceplane and companion Shooting Star cargo module. As part of its contract, Sierra Space was awarded a minimum seven flights, and the agency previously issued firm-fixed price task orders for four Dream Chaser resupply missions based on the needs of the space station. After a thorough evaluation, NASA and Sierra Space have mutually agreed to modify the contract as the company determined Dream Chaser development is best served by a free flight demonstration, targeted in late 2026. Sierra Space will continue providing insight to NASA into the development of Dream Chaser, including through the flight demonstration. NASA will provide minimal support through the remainder of the development and the flight demonstration. As part of the modification, NASA is no longer obligated for a specific number of resupply missions, however, the agency may order Dream Chaser resupply flights to the space station from Sierra Space following a successful free flight as part of its current contract.  “Development of new space transportation systems is difficult and can take longer than what’s originally planned.  The ability to perform a flight demonstration can be a key enabler in a spacecraft’s development and readiness, as well as offering greater flexibility for NASA and Sierra Space,” said Dana Weigel, manager of NASA’s International Space Station Program. “As NASA and its partners look toward space station deorbit in 2030, this mutually agreed to decision enables testing and verification to continue on Dream Chaser, as well as demonstrating the capabilities of the spaceplane for future resupply missions in low Earth orbit.” NASA, and its commercial and international partners, will continue to supply the orbital complex with critical science, supplies, and hardware as the agency prepares to transition to commercial space stations in low Earth orbit.   NASA continues to work with a variety of private companies to develop a competitive, space industrial base for cargo services, which will be needed for future commercial space stations. With a strong economy in low Earth orbit, NASA will be one of many customers of private industry as the agency explores the Moon under the Artemis campaign and Mars along with commercial and international partners.",

      "title": "NASA-ISRO Satellite Sends First Radar Images of Earth’s Surface",
      "description": "",
      "content": "Captured on Aug. 21, this image from NISAR’s L-band radar shows Maine’s Mount Desert Island. Green indicates forest; magenta represents hard or regular surfaces, like bare ground and buildings. The magenta area on the island’s northeast end is the town of Bar Harbor. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech The NISAR (NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar) Earth-observing radar satellite’s first images of our planet’s surface are in, and they offer a glimpse of things to come as the joint mission between NASA and ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) approaches full science operations later this year. “Launched under President Trump in conjunction with India, NISAR’s first images are a testament to what can be achieved when we unite around a shared vision of innovation and discovery,” said acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy. “This is only the beginning. NASA will continue to build upon the incredible scientific advancements of the past and present as we pursue our goal to maintain our nation’s space dominance through Gold Standard Science.” Images from the spacecraft, which was launched by ISRO on July 30, display the level of detail with which NISAR scans Earth to provide unique, actionable information to decision-makers in a diverse range of areas, including disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and agricultural management. “By understanding how our home planet works, we can produce models and analysis of how other planets in our solar system and beyond work as we prepare to send humanity on an epic journey back to the Moon and onward to Mars,” said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya. “The successful capture of these first images from NISAR is a remarkable example of how partnership and collaboration between two nations, on opposite sides of the world, can achieve great things together for the benefit of all.” On Aug. 21, the satellite’s L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, which was provided by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, captured Mount Desert Island on the Maine coast. Dark areas represent water, while green areas are forest, and magenta areas are hard or regular surfaces, such as bare ground and buildings. The L-band radar system can resolve objects as small as 15 feet (5 meters), enabling the image to display narrow waterways cutting across the island, as well as the islets dotting the waters around it. Then, on Aug. 23, the L-band SAR captured data of a portion of northeastern North Dakota straddling Grand Forks and Walsh counties. The image shows forests and wetlands on the banks of the Forest River passing through the center of the frame from west to east and farmland to the north and south. The dark agricultural plots show fallow fields, while the lighter colors represent the presence of pasture or crops, such as soybean and corn. Circular patterns indicate the use of center-pivot irrigation. On Aug. 23, NISAR imaged land adjacent to northeastern North Dakota’s Forest River. Light-colored wetlands and forests line the river’s banks, while circular and rectangular plots throughout the image appear in shades that indicate the land may be pasture or cropland with corn or soy.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech The images demonstrate how the L-band SAR can discern what type of land cover — low-lying vegetation, trees, and human structures — is present in each area. This capability is vital both for monitoring the gain and loss of forest and wetland ecosystems, as well as for tracking the progress of crops through growing seasons around the world. “These initial images are just a preview of the hard-hitting science that NISAR will produce — data and insights that will enable scientists to study Earth’s changing land and ice surfaces in unprecedented detail while equipping decision-makers to respond to natural disasters and other challenges,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator, Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “They are also a testament to the years of hard work of hundreds of scientists and engineers from both sides of the world to build an observatory with the most advanced radar system ever launched by NASA and ISRO.” The L-band system uses a 10-inch (25-centimeter) wavelength that enables its signal to penetrate forest canopies and measure soil moisture and motion of ice surfaces and land down to fractions of an inch, which is a key measurement in understanding how the land surface moves before, during, and after earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides. The preliminary L-band images are an example of what the mission team will be able to produce when the science phase begins in November. The satellite was raised into its operational 464-mile (747-kilometer) orbit in mid-September. The NISAR mission also includes an S-band radar, provided by ISRO’s Space Applications Centre, that uses a 4-inch (10-centimeter) microwave signal that is more sensitive to small vegetation, making it effective at monitoring certain types of agriculture and grassland ecosystems. The spacecraft is the first to carry both L- and S-band radars. The satellite will monitor Earth’s land and ice surfaces twice every 12 days, collecting data using the spacecraft’s drum-shaped antenna reflector, which measures 39 feet (12 meters) wide — the largest NASA has ever sent into space. The NISAR mission is a partnership between NASA and ISRO spanning years of technical and programmatic collaboration. The successful launch and deployment of NISAR builds on a strong heritage of cooperation between the United States and India in space. The Space Applications Centre provided the mission’s S-band SAR. The U R Rao Satellite Centre provided the spacecraft bus. The launch vehicle was provided by Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, and launch services were through Satish Dhawan Space Centre. Key operations, including boom and radar antenna reflector deployment, are now being executed and monitored by the ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network’s global system of ground stations. Managed by Caltech in Pasadena, NASA JPL leads the U.S. component of the project. In addition to the L-band SAR, reflector, and boom, JPL also provided the high-rate communication subsystem for science data, a solid-state data recorder, and payload data subsystem. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the Near Space Network, which receives NISAR’s L-band data.

      "title": "How the Grinch Stole Christmas Is Getting a 4K Steelbook and It's the Jim Carrey Version",
      "description": "",
      "content": "One of the most contested topics of conversation between my friends and I every year is about which Grinch movie is the best Grinch movie. I am of the opinion that the original animated version is the only adaptation of the iconic Dr. Seuss character that matters, but my friend group is convinced that the live-action version of the film is far superior. Seeing as the Grinch has been portrayed in three different movies at this point, these arguments are likely only going to get more heated as the younger generation joins the conversation.Regardless of where you land on which Grinch movie is the best, the Jim Carrey version of the film is the only one getting a new limited-edition 4K steelbook this year. The upcoming collectible edition is available to preorder now for $32.99 and will officially release on November 11. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the film, which has become somewhat of a consistent milestone for steelbook releases on older movies.Dr. Seuss How the Grinch Stole Christmas 4K Steelbook PreorderIf you aren't familiar with how limited-edition steelbook releases usually work, it's worth noting that it comes with three versions of the film. You get two discs, the 4K UHD version and the Blu-ray version, as well as a digital copy of the movie you can download. This may seem like overkill, but if your main reason for buying the collector's edition is to keep it on your shelf, then the digital version is a great way to avoid having to actually take it off your shelf. The physical copies ensure you'll always have access to the movie, but getting the downloadable version separately will help you integrate it seamlessly into any existing streaming setup.Bonus FeaturesIn addition to the steelbook case and extra disc, the 25th anniversary edition of this movie also includes bonus features. Here's a quick rundown of what you'll get in the bonus features included:25 Years Later: The Gift of the GrinchFeature commentary with director Ron HowardDeleted scenes outtakesWho schoolMakeup application and design Seussian set decorationVisual effects for Faith Hill's \"Where Are You Christmas\" music videoWhat Is Amazon's Preorder Price Guarantee?If you've never actually preordered anything from Amazon before, it's worth noting that if you purchase this steelbook at Amazon, it includes a preorder price guarantee. According to Amazon's own help page, this means that if the price decreases between now and when the item ships, you'll pay the lowest price.This is one of the reasons Amazon is overall one of the best places to 4K and Blu-ray movies before they actually release. Many popular movie preorders will actually receive discounts before their release date, so having a guarantee you'll still get those even if you lock in your preorder now is hard to pass up.More Upcoming 4k UHD and Blu-raysThere are plenty of other upcoming 4K releases to look forward to we've featured below. And if you're a fan of Jim Carrey, there's also a new preorder for The Mask in 4K that's worth a look.If you're interested in even more upcoming home releases, scroll through the catalog above to see what's available for preorder.",

      "title": "Borderlands 4 Gets FOV Slider on Console, Performance Improvements, and Gear Buffs in Big New Update",
      "description": "",
      "content": "Borderlands 4 developer Gearbox has released the biggest update to the looter shooter since launch, adding a Field of View (FOV) slider on console, performance improvements, and various Vault Hunter and gear buffs.The September 25, 2025 update adds new Weekly Activities, stability and performance improvements, adjustments to some rewards/progression, and further refinements across UI, audio, visuals, and gear. Check out the patch notes, from the Borderlands website, below.Of particular note is the addition of a FOV slider on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, something players had asked for. Gearbox chief Randy Pitchford had responded to the complaints to suggest fairness might have had something to do with the lack of a FOV slider in Borderlands 4, although all that comment did was confuse fans given the PC version has it and there’s crossplay at launch. While its arrival is welcome, Gearbox warned console players that increasing the FOV past the default could cause some dips in performance.Creative director Graeme Timmins had flagged that Gearbox was more interested in buffing than nerfing Borderlands 4 in the short term, leaving broken builds alone for the time being. And today's update reinforces that approach, with no nerfs to speak of. Indeed, Timmins took to social media to say Gearbox had too many buffs to fit into today’s update, so it broke them up into their own balance update that’s due out early next week.The update also includes fixes for the high-profile memory leak issue for Borderlands 4 on console, which causes the framerate to degrade the longer you play. But there’s more to come. “We believe we've made significant improvements there, but we're still investigating data to make sure any remaining issues continue to be resolved,” Timmins explained. “We're confident that today's update makes a big difference though, and we're excited to get feedback/data on it.”Performance improvements on PC are also welcome. Borderlands 4 is still on a mixed Steam review rating, with most of the negative comments revolving around PC performance. The tech experts at Digital Foundry have said their initial analysis of Borderlands 4 on PC shows significant stutter problems, and have advised against running the game on its ‘Badass’ graphics setting, which suggests there are indeed problems with the Unreal Engine 5 title.If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without an updated hourly SHiFT codes list. We've also got a huge interactive map ready to go and a badass Borderlands 4 planner tool courtesy of our buds at Maxroll. Plus check out our expert players' choices for which character to choose (no one agreed).Borderlands 4 September 25, 2025 update patch notes:Change List:Weekly Activities: Weekly Big Encore Boss has switched to a tougher variant of a different existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool for those that take it on.

      "description": "",
      "content": "As part of its exclusive GeForce Week event, Walmart is currently offering amazing deals on three prebuilt gaming systems all equipped with the GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card. Prices start at just $1,099, although arguably the best deal may be the model with the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU for $100 more. I think these deals are as good as the ones we will see during Black Friday. They're also all sold and shipped from Walmart direct and not a marketplace vendor.The GeForce RTX 5070 GPU is an excellent choice for 1080p or 1440p gamingCompared to the previous generation GPUs, the RTX 5070 performs a bit better than the RTX 4070 Super. I wish there was a bigger generation improvement in raw performance, but the RTX 5070 is still a superior graphics card because it supports DLSS 4 and has 12GB of the newer GDDR7 VRAM on top of the slight performance improvement. You probably won't even find an RTX 4070 Super gaming PC for less than $1,100, either. The RTX 5070 is a popular GPU for 1080p or 1440 gaming. The next card up - the RTX 5070 Ti - is significantly more expensive and really for gamers who want high fps 1440p or 4K gaming. Anything less demanding and it's probably overkill.

These deals are, frankly, so good that they're worth picking up before Black Friday. This sale appears to be run by Walmart so you probably won't find these deals anywhere else (unless another retailer price matches).

Lifelong STEM learning helps people build critical knowledge and skills, access economic opportunities, drive innovation, and make informed decisions in a changing world. STEM learning ecosystems draw on expertise and resources to provide access to these benefits for the entire community. NASA’s Science Activation (SciAct) program, a competitively-selected network of collaborative projects that connect NASA science with people of all ages and backgrounds, includes new and growing STEM learning ecosystems in American communities from Alaska to Maine and creates free, high-quality resources that educators across the country can use to share the excitement of Earth and space science. To further support connections among STEM learning ecosystems and NASA, the SciAct STEM Ecosystems project held a meeting in Saint Paul, Minnesota on August 4-6, 2025. Approximately 100 educators, evaluators, subject matter experts, and other STEM learning facilitators from around the nation participated to share approaches, learn about resources, and build relationships. The gathering offered an opportunity to connect NASA SciAct teams with each other and with external networks and learning ecosystems for mutual benefit. Meeting goals included sharing ways to create effective partnerships and engage learners in Earth and space science, discovering NASA resources and assets to use in STEM education efforts, and strengthening connections among participants. To accomplish these goals, meeting activities included plenaries, breakout sessions, and networking opportunities. Led by Arizona State University, the SciAct STEM Ecosystems project is a collaboration among several regional partnerships/SciAct project teams: Arctic and Earth SIGNs, Learning Ecosystems Northeast, Rural Activation and Innovation Network, and the Smoky Mountains STEM Collaborative. The project also partners with the National Informal STEM Education Network to create professional resources. For those who were unable to attend in person, the STEM Ecosystems project makes a variety of resources available online: https://www.nisenet.org/stem-learning-ecosystems. SciAct STEM Ecosystems is supported by NASA under cooperative agreement award number 80NSSC21M0007 and is part of NASA’s Science Activation Portfolio. Learn more about how Science Activation connects NASA science experts, real content, and experiences with community leaders to do science in ways that activate minds and promote deeper understanding of our world and beyond: https://science.nasa.gov/learn/about-science-activation/. Meeting participants took advantage of opportunities to network and strengthen their relationships.

      "title": "The T-Mobile \"Apple iPhone 17 On Us\" Deals Explained",
      "description": "",
      "content": "The new Apple iPhone 17 has just been released and as usual, the best way to score a deal on these new phones is through your preferred service provider. T-Mobile, now the best mobile network in the US (according to Ookla® Speedtest®), is already advertising a couple of promotions, including excellent trade-in values on older iPhone models. If you're porting your number over from another service, then you may not even need to trade in your existing phone.Get up to $1,100 off the New Apple iPhone 17 Pro with Trade-InRight now you can order a new Apple iPhone 17 Pro through T-Mobile and score up to $1,100 off in trade-in credit when you sign up for a new line on the Experience Beyond plan with AutoPay. Depending on which phone you trade in, you may be able to fully pay off a new iPhone 17 Pro 256GB phone (MSRP $1,099.99).Here are the trade-in values T-Mobile has currently listed on its site. Note that other phones may also be eligible, but if that's the case, their values haven't been advertised yet:iPhone 13 Pro - $1100 trade-in valueiPhone 12 Pro - $830 trade-in valueiPhone 6 - $550 trade-in valueThe discount is applied in the form of 24 monthly bill credits. That means you will need to maintain your service for at least 2 years to get the maximum discount. The credits end if you terminate your contract early or you pay off your phone early. Note that there is also a $35 device connection charge and your account must remain in good standing.The Experience Beyond plan costs $100 per month for a single line with AutoPay (plus taxes and fees). The plan gives you unlimited talk, text, and 5G premium data. Other perks include Netflix (Standard with ads), Apple TV+, and Hulu subscriptions, unlimited mobile hotspot, full-flight texting and Wi-Fi with streaming where available, phone upgrade eligibility every year, and a 5 year price guarantee. International travelers can also benefit from unlimited text and 30GB of high-speed data in Canada and Mexico and unlimited text and 15GB of high-speed data in over 215 other countries.Get T-Mobile's \"Apple iPhone 17 On Us\" with No Trade-in RequiredFor those of you who don't plan on trading in an existing phone, you can still get an Apple iPhone 17 (MSRP $799.99) simply by switching over to T-Mobile from a competing service (AT&T, Verizon, Claro, UScellular, Xfinity, Spectrum, and Liberty PR) and signing up for a new line on an $85+/mo service with AutoPay. Similar to the iPhone 17 Pro trade-in promotion, the discount is paid out across 24 monthly bill credits. That means you will need to maintain your service for at least 2 years to get the maximum discount. A $35 device connection charge also applies.The Experience More plan costs $85 per month for a single line with AutoPay (plus taxes and fees). Like the Experience Beyond plan, you get unlimited talk, text, and 5G premium data, but not as many extra perks. Benefits include Netflix (Standard with ads) and Apple TV+ subscriptions. 60GB of mobile hotspot, full-flight texting and Wi-Fi with streaming where available, phone upgrade eligibility every two years, and a 5 year price guarantee. You also get unlimited text and 15GB of high-speed data in Canada and Mexico and unlimited text and 5GB of high-speed data in other countries.For more info, check the math at T-Mobile.com/Switch.For a Third Option, Skip the Bill Credits and Buy the Phone Outright, Then Sign Up for the $25 Metro by T-Mobile PlanYou might think buying an iPhone outright isn't really a deal, and technically you'd be correct, but there's a good chance that you might actually be saving money in the long run. If you're looking to purchase an iPhone 7 and don't expect to replace it in a year or two, the Metro by T-Mobile BYOD plan might end up being the best choice for you.The Metro by T-Mobile plan offers one line of unlimited talk, text, and 5G data for $30 for the first month and $25 per month afterwards with AutoPay. Taxes and fees are already included. You're guaranteed this price for 5 years, although being a prepaid plan, you're free to opt out at any time. In addition, you get perks like Scam Shield, which enables Caller ID and blocks or redirects spam calls, and T-Mobile Tuesdays, a program that gives you access to freebies and exclusive discounts every Tuesday. Note that speeds may slow if you go over a soft cap of greater than 35GB per month. The Metro plan only costs $25 per month, compared to $85 for the Experience More plan and $100 for the Experience Beyond plan. That's a difference of $60-$70 every month on your phone bill. If you hold onto your phone for 3 years, you're saving $2,160 to $2,520 on your bill. That's plenty of savings to afford your next iPhone upgrade down the line.Note that some exclusions apply. See details at MetrobyT-Mobile.com. Apple iPhone 17 Phones Released on September 19Apple recently released three iPhone models: the iPhone 17, iPhone Air, and iPhone 17 Pro/Pro Max.

      "title": "Apple iPhone 17 review: Sometimes boring is best",
      "description": "",
      "content": "Apple seems determined to leave a persistent gap between the cameras of its Pro iPhones and the regular ones, but most other features—the edge-to-edge-screen design with FaceID, the Dynamic Island, OLED display panels, Apple Intelligence compatibility—eventually trickle down to the regular-old iPhone after a generation or two of timed exclusivity. One feature that Apple has been particularly slow to move down the chain is ProMotion, the branding the company uses to refer to a screen that can refresh up to 120 times per second rather than the more typical 60 times per second. ProMotion isn't a necessary feature, but since Apple added it to the iPhone 13 Pro in 2021, the extra fluidity and smoothness, plus the always-on display feature, have been big selling points for the Pro phones. This year, ProMotion finally comes to the regular-old iPhone 17, years after midrange and even lower-end Android phones made the swap to 90 or 120 Hz display panels. And it sounds like a small thing, but the screen upgrade—together with a doubling of base storage from 128GB to 256GB—makes the gap between this year's iPhone and iPhone Pro feel narrower than it's been in a long time. If you jumped on the Pro train a few years back and don't want to spend that much again, this might be a good year to switch back. If you've ever been tempted by the Pro but never made the upgrade, you can continue not doing that and miss out on relatively little.Read full article Comments",

He began training for his first space station flight assignment immediately after completing initial astronaut candidate training. Williams was born in New York City, and considers Potomac, Maryland, his hometown. He holds a bachelor’s degree in physics from Stanford University in California and a doctorate in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, where his research focused on astrophysics. Williams completed medical physics residency training at Harvard Medical School in Boston. He was working as a clinical physicist and researcher at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston when he was selected as an astronaut candidate. The International Space Station is a convergence of science, technology, and human innovation enabling research not possible on Earth. For nearly 25 years, NASA has supported a continuous U.S. human presence aboard the orbiting laboratory, where astronauts have learned to live and work in space for extended periods of time. The space station is a springboard for developing a low Earth economy and NASA’s next great leaps in human exploration at the Moon under the Artemis campaign and Mars.

      "content": "Amazon has agreed to settle a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit accusing the e-commerce giants of tricking customers into signing up for Prime and then making it frustratingly hard to cancel. In a press release Thursday, the FTC confirmed that, pending court approval, Amazon will pay a $1 billion civil penalty and provide $1.5 billion in refunds to an estimated 35 million customers \"harmed by their deceptive Prime enrollment practices.\" Former FTC chair Lina Khan initiated the lawsuit, accusing customers of trapping customers in a “labyrinthine” Prime cancellation process the company named after Homer’s Iliad. The civil penalty, the FTC noted, is \"the largest ever in a case involving an FTC rule violation,\" and the refunds to customers are \"the second-highest restitution award ever obtained by FTC action.\"Read full article Comments",

      "description": "",
      "content": "Generative AI systems that create text, images, audio, and even video are becoming commonplace. In the same way AI models output those data types, they can also be used to output robot actions. That's the foundation of Google DeepMind's Gemini Robotics project, which has announced a pair of new models that work together to create the first robots that \"think\" before acting. Traditional LLMs have their own set of problems, but the introduction of simulated reasoning did significantly upgrade their capabilities, and now the same could be happening with AI robotics. The team at DeepMind contends that generative AI is a uniquely important technology for robotics because it unlocks general functionality. Current robots have to be trained intensively on specific tasks, and they are typically bad at doing anything else. \"Robots today are highly bespoke and difficult to deploy, often taking many months in order to install a single cell that can do a single task,\" said Carolina Parada, head of robotics at Google DeepMind. The fundamentals of generative systems make AI-powered robots more general. They can be presented with entirely new situations and workspaces without needing to be reprogrammed. DeepMind's current approach to robotics relies on two models: one that thinks and one that does.Read full article Comments",

Many of these features rely on Apple Intelligence, meaning they're only as reliable and helpful as Apple's generative AI (and only available on newer iPhones, besides). Other adjustments are smaller but could make a big difference to people who use their phone to do work tasks. Reminders attempt to get smarter The Reminders app gets the Apple Intelligence treatment in iOS 26, with the AI primarily focused on making it easier to organize content within Reminders lists. Lines in Reminders lists are often short, quickly jotted-down blurbs rather than lengthy, detailed complex instructions. With this in mind, it’s easy to see how the AI can sometimes lack enough information in order to perform certain tasks, like logically grouping different errands into sensible sections.Read full article Comments",

      "content": "Apple has demanded Brussels scrap its landmark Big Tech legislation, marking a step up in US tech giants’ fight against European oversight. The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which entered into force in 2022, aims to curb the power of Big Tech and level the playing field for smaller rivals, with fines of up to 10 percent of global revenue for companies that do not comply. Apple’s call to repeal the law comes at a time of transatlantic tensions over the EU’s digital rule book, including the DMA.Read full article Comments",

      "content": "There are plenty of rivalries in the US launch industry. People who build big and brawny machines tend to have egos to match. And if you chat up the senior executives of these rocket companies offline, they are often more than happy to say derogatory things about their competitors. But rarely are such sentiments expressed in public, without filter. Chris Kemp, the chief executive officer of Astra, apparently didn't get the memo about playing nice. Kemp made some spicy remarks at the Berkeley Space Symposium 2025 earlier this month, billed as the largest undergraduate aerospace event at the university (see video of the talk). He provided an overview of Astra's successes and failures, and generally sought to make a good impression on prospective interns at the company, and future employees.

      "description": "",
      "content": "3 min readPreparations for Next Moonwalk Simulations Underway (and Underwater) Since April 1999, the AeroSpace Frontiers (AF) newsletter has shared information monthly on NASA Glenn Research Center’s people, projects, and progress. If you were looking for news on any of these topics, there was a good chance you could read all about them in AF each month.  The newsletter has evolved in the last 26 years, changing with the times, to improve how and when we communicate with our audiences. From updating the hard copy layout to offering the issue online, we adjusted and enhanced AF to meet our customers’ needs.   As methods of sharing news and information are now available that allow us to reach you sooner, we are shifting our focus to these platforms and discontinuing our monthly newsletter. This September issue will be our last.   We hope you’ll stay connected with us through our official website and social media channels: Facebook, X, Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube. We thank you for your readership!   Before closing, we want to celebrate and reflect on the newsletter’s remarkable tenure (and interesting names) over the years.  Credit: NASA The Story Behind the Name: A Look Back  While the center published a newsletter continually (with a brief pause in the early 1960s) since its opening in 1942, its name, layout, and content evolved over the decades. It began in 1942 as Wing Tips, an internal biweekly newsletter, and was later renamed Orbit in October 1958 as the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics transitioned to NASA. In 1961, the center paused the newsletter’s publication to focus its resources on the early space program.  The publication reemerged in 1964 as Lewis News and expanded to a larger newsletter format in 1969, in conjunction with the Apollo 11 Moon landing. This format continued until 1995, when Lewis News moved to a monthly schedule with expanded, but physically smaller, issues as part of an overall effort to reduce spending.   Then, in 1999 – prior to the center being renamed NASA’s John H. Glenn Research Center – employees and center management were surveyed for a new newsletter title that would not be tied to future changes in research activities or center names. The group selected AeroSpace Frontiers to represent the modernization of the newsletter’s appearance and its expanded subject matter. It was now a monthly news magazine that included a variety of graphics and photographs, as well as additional content that addressed audiences beyond the center.   About Our Amazing Editor Portrait of editor Doreen Zudell, taken in 1990 at NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. At that time, the center newsletter was known as Lewis News.Credit: NASA Doreen Zudell has served as the editor of AeroSpace Frontiers (AF) since the first issue in 1999 and has been a driving force behind the publication ever since. In addition to writing and editing stories each month, she also has navigated many format changes over the years.   Editor Doreen Zudell interviews NASA astronaut Doug Wheelock at NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland in 2019.Credit: NASA/Marvin Smith “We appreciate Doreen’s knowledge, experience, and passion for sharing Glenn’s news and accomplishments with AF readers,” said NASA Glenn Office of Communications Director Kristen Parker. “Her compassion, journalistic flair, and dedication to putting employees’ needs first is evident in everything she does.”   Return to Newsletter Explore More 2 min read NASA Glenn Reinforces Role in Aerospace Innovation During Ohio Space Week Article 16 hours ago 1 min read Glenn Highlights Space Exploration at Minnesota State Fair Article 16 hours ago 2 min read NASA Names Glenn’s Steven Sinacore to Lead Fission Surface Power Article 16 hours ago",

Credit: NASA/Christopher Richards NASA brought the excitement of space exploration to the Minnesota State Fair from Aug. 21–24, offering exhibits and interactive experiences for the whole family. Led by NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, the agency showcased the future of space exploration and the technologies making it possible — from next-generation spacesuits to the Artemis missions that will return humans to the Moon.  A major attraction was Glenn’s “Suits and Boots” exhibit, along with an Apollo 15 Moon rock, which drew large crowds to the North End Event Center. Glenn staff, joined by Mike Lammers, deputy chief of the Flight Director’s Office at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, engaged with both media and fairgoers to highlight spacesuit advancements, Glenn’s unique role as the only NASA center in the Midwest, and upcoming plans for returning to the Moon and journeying to Mars through Artemis.

Cisco said Wednesday that the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-20352, was present in all supported versions of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE, the operating system that powers a wide variety of the company’s networking devices. The vulnerability can be exploited by low-privileged users to create a denial-of-service attack or by higher-privileged users to execute code that runs with unfettered root privileges. It carries a severity rating of 7.7 out of a possible 10. Exposing SNMP to the Internet? Yep “The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) became aware of successful exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild after local Administrator credentials were compromised,” Wednesday’s advisory stated. “Cisco strongly recommends that customers upgrade to a fixed software release to remediate this vulnerability.”Read full article Comments",

      "content": "Formula 1 might be riding high these days on a wave of interest not seen since the 1960s, but the Drive to Survive effect has been felt elsewhere in the world of motorsport. Endurance racing like the 24 Hours of Le Mans or the Rolex 24 at Daytona has seen record crowds over the last few years, and a large part of that is down to the sports prototype class, exemplified by cars from the likes of Ferrari and Porsche. And soon, we can add Ford to the list. Currently, eight different manufacturers are competing against each other in the World Endurance Championship's Hypercar class: Alpine, Aston Martin, BMW, Cadillac, Ferrari, Peugeot, Porsche, and Toyota. More are on the way—Genesis arrives next year, and at the beginning of the year, Ford announced that it, too, was joining the fray, in 2027. Today, the Blue Oval revealed some more details about the project. What’s a hypercar? Compared to the road car-derived machines that race in the GT3 category, the vehicles that contest for overall victory in the Hypercar class are purpose-built prototypes, just for racing. Because endurance racing often has to be needlessly complicated for the sake of being complicated, the Hypercar class is actually made up of a mix of vehicles designed to two different technical rule sets that are performance balanced to create a level playing field.Read full article Comments",

      "content": "A lot of the stuff we use today is largely made by robots—arms with multiple degrees of freedom positioned along conveyor belts that move in a spectacle of precisely synchronized motions. All this motion is usually programmed by hand, which can take hundreds to thousands of hours. Google’s DeepMind team has developed an AI system called RoboBallet that lets manufacturing robots figure out what to do on their own. Traveling salesmen Planning what manufacturing robots should do to get their jobs done efficiently is really hard to automate. You need to solve both task allocation and scheduling—deciding which task should be done by which robot in what order. It’s like the famous traveling salesman problem on steroids. On top of that, there is the question of motion planning; you need to make sure all these robotic arms won’t collide with each other or with all the gear standing around them. At the end, you’re facing myriad possible combinations where you’ve got to solve not one but three computationally hard problems at the same time. “There are some tools that let you automate motion planning, but task allocation and scheduling are usually done manually,” says Matthew Lai, a research engineer at Google DeepMind. “Solving all three of these problems combined is what we tackled in our work.”Read full article Comments",

      "content": "For decades now, the Microsoft Flight Simulator franchise has been associated with Microsoft's own DOS/Windows operating systems and, more recently, Xbox consoles (weird exceptions like this 1986 Macintosh port notwithstanding). However, that era seems set to end as Sony announced during this evening's State of Play livestream that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will come to the PlayStation 5 on December 8. No, that's not a typo. Credit: Sony The move isn't entirely shocking for modern Microsoft, which has been publishing previous Xbox exclusives on competing consoles in increasing numbers for a while now. And Flight Simulator 2024 has been available on Xbox Series S/X for almost a year now, as the name suggests, giving Xbox owners a \"timed exclusive\" at least. Still, it's a bit striking to see a franchise that literally has the Microsoft brand name integrated into its title moving to a major non-Microsoft platform like this. The impact is a little bit like seeing a Sonic game on a Nintendo console for the first time in 2001, after years of Sega selling itself as the anti-Nintendo.Read full article Comments",
