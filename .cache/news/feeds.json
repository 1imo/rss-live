      "description": "",
      "content": "If you're looking for a high-capacity, high-output power bank with a slim footprint, then check out this deal from Baseus. Amazon is currently offering the Baseus Blade 20,000mAh 100W power bank for $39.99 shipped after you apply coupon code \"3M6HOJ2F\". This is similar to the last deal I posted on the same item, but this time the deal is available for everyone, not just Amazon Prime members. Unlike most high-capacity power banks that are shaped like a chunky bar, the Baseus Blade is much slimmer. It's powerful enough to charge just about every gaming handheld PC at its fastest rate.Baseus Blade 20,000mAh 100W Slim Power Bank for $39.99The Baseus Blade measures only 0.7 inches thick. Most high-capacity power banks are well over 1\" in thickness. The Iniu gets away with a thinner body by instead going with a wide body design, which means it's more square shaped andsquare 5\" x 5\". The form factor allows it to fit perfectly in a laptop bag or backpack sleeve. It still weighs in at about one pound which is comparable to other power banks, so no give or take there.The wide body allows it to squeeze in four ports: two USB Type-C ports each with 100W of Power Delivery and two USB Type-A ports each with 30W output. Note that the maximum charging output is 100W. That means although all three ports add up to a total of 160W, only a maximum of 100W will be delivered across all three ports if they are used simultaneously.The 20,000mAh capacity can fully recharge all of your gaming handheldsThis Baseus Blade boasts a generous 20,000mAh, or 74Whr battery capacity. If you factor in 80% power efficiency, here are the approximate number of times you can fully recharge each gaming handheld or iPhone model:Nintendo Switch 2 (18Whr) about 3.3 timesNintendo Switch (16Whr) about 3.7 timesSteam Deck (40Whr) about 1.5 timesAsus ROG Ally (40Whr) about 1.5 timesAsus ROG Ally X (80Whr) about 0.7 timesLenovo Legion Go (50Whr) about 1.2 timesLenovo Legion Go S (55Whr) about 1 timeApple iPhone 16 (14Whr) about 4.2 timesApple iPhone 16 Plus (18Whr) about 3.3 timesThe 100W output can fast charge nearly all phones and gaming handheldsThe Baseus Blade has USB Type-C ports that provides up to 100W of power output It will automatically throttle down to whatever maximum rate the plugged-in device accepts. The Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 can only accept a maximum of 18W-30W of power output. The Steam Deck can accept up to 39W. The Asus ROG Ally accepts up to 65W. The Asus ROG Ally X (and the upcoming Xbox Ally X) and Lenovo Legion Go S can actually achieve charging rates up to 100W.This power bank can be brought onto airplanesYou don't need to worry about being stopped at airports. The 20,000mAh 74Whr capacity is well below TSA's 27,000mAh/100Whr carry-on limit, so you are safely in the clear.For more options, check out our favorite portable power banks for traveling.How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.

      "description": "",
      "content": "If this latest report is accurate, you can forget about Henry Cavill or Idris Elba being the next James Bond.According to Deadline’s sources, the filmmakers are looking to cast a “fresh face” as 007 in James Bond 26, specifically an unknown male British actor in their late 20s to early 30s. This “fresh face” criteria would rule out a number of oft-rumored “next James Bond” candidates, including Tom Holland, Taron Egerton, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Although there were recent reports about unknown English actor Scott Rose-Marsh screen-testing as 007 for Bond 26 director Denis Villeneuve, Deadline’s source claims “the casting process has not begun and it won’t until Denis finishes the [third] Dune movie.” The source says it’s possible that the next Bond could be played by a non-white actor, though “it’ll come down to this: Are they right for Bond? Are they right for the story that Villeneuve and screenwriter [Steven] Knight will be telling?”Deadline emphasizes that Bond 26 will not be a continuation of where No Time to Die left the saga with the death of Daniel Craig’s James Bond. “It’s a new Bond, a new start, a fresh everything,” the site’s source claims.James Bond 26 begins filming in 2027 for a 2028 release date.Bond 26 is the first 007 film for Amazon MGM Studios and under the stewardship of new producers David Heyman and Amy Pascal, who took over from Bond franchise producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson.",

      "title": "Marvel Rivals Character Tier List: Season 4",
      "description": "",
      "content": "The balance of power has changed once again in Marvel Rivals Season 4, which introduced plenty of hero adjustments to shake things up. If you're wondering which characters are routinely dominating lobbies, or who we think is perhaps a more situational choice, we've got you covered with our Marvel Rivals Season 4 tier list. Below, you'll find our ranking, with S rank being the strongest characters and D being the weakest.Marvel Rivals Season 4 Tier ListS-Tier: Emma Frost, Doctor Strange, Magneto, Wolverine, LokiA-Tier: The Thing, Groot, Thor, Magik, Namor, Psylocke, Angela, The Punisher, Winter Soldier, Cloak & Dagger, Luna Snow, PhoenixB-Tier: Peni Parker, Venom, Hela, Human Torch, Iron Man, Moon Knight, Spider-Man, Invisible Woman, Ultron, Hulk, Iron Fist, Captain America, Squirrel Girl, Black Panther, Rocket RaccoonC-Tier: Hawkeye, Mister Fantastic, Star-Lord, Storm, Adam Warlock, Mantis, Scarlet WitchD-Tier: Black Widow, Jeff the Land SharkDisagree with our rankings? Put together your own Marvel Rivals tier list and contribute to the community vote below.S-Tier Marvel Rivals HeroesEmma FrostEmma Frost has been a force to be reckoned with ever since she debuted in Season 2; she's a good old-fashioned tank. With Emma, you can run up to the front line and clear a path for your team to move forward, and even throw up a shield to defend her teammates. But the best part is her Diamond form, which she can use to essentially shut down any incoming dives and cut off potential ultimates that require a build-up. Doctor StrangeEven with all the tinkering, Doctor Strange remains one of the best characters. He can fit into any build and is incredibly useful: he can shield himself and everyone around him, and with a well-placed attack, he can be a distraction for the frontline while popping some shots at healers. The best thing about him is his portal. When this is used in overtime, it can make all the difference between winning or losing a round.MagnetoMagneto is an excellent hero for a lot of the same reasons as Doctor Strange. They play very similarly to one another and can both fit into any build. What makes him especially dangerous, though, is his ult: if timed right, it can one-shot a Cloak & Dagger, Luna Snow, or Invisible Woman while they ult.WolverineWolverine is a constant threat in any circumstance. Even though he's small in size, he has a large presence on the battlefield. Much of Wolverine's kit is built around diving the backline or making a hole for the team to push through. A well-placed Wolverine can easily make all the difference, because if he's not making the healers run for their lives, he's bullying the tanks in front. If that's not dangerous enough, he can heal himself and get away on a moment's notice. LokiLoki is a multipurpose healer, thanks to his clones. He may be one of the most complex characters to master, but learning him is well worth it. His clones can be used to set up a line of fire that can hold down a position until backup arrives, and being able to confuse your opponents about who's the real one can buy your team time to attack. If you ever find yourself in a close battle, his ability to turn himself into whatever character he wants can make all the difference in a close fight.A-Tier Marvel Rivals HeroesThe ThingHere's The Thing… he's just great. This orange pile of rocks is easily one of the best additions to a support tank. His recent buffs last season have made him even more dangerous, because not only can he shut down dive players, but he can now smack flyers out of the sky. He's straightforward in that he only has a couple of attacks, but each one can pack a serious punch. If you're looking for a tank that can rush straight into a fight, The Thing is the one for you.GrootGroot has always been good right from the start, but he's lost some of his flair throughout the last couple of seasons. He's still a danger whenever he pops up in a game, though. Being able to wall off opponents and prevent them from escaping or getting healed is an absolute game-changer. If you find yourself being terrorized by a diver, you can simply trap them in the backfield and quickly take care of them before they become more of a threat.ThorThor has slowly been improving since Season 1. He wasn't much use initially, and getting a lot of mileage out of him required some real planning. But thanks to a handful of buffs he's received, he's now one of the standout characters. Like the Hulk, he can be played in a couple of different ways, meaning that you can have him on the frontline and take some damage, or you can dive the backfield with him to create a distraction. MagikIt's really hard to go wrong with Dive heroes. Even though they're extremely annoying to deal with, having one on your team can make you feel like an unstoppable force of nature. Magik is easily one of the best dive characters to have, largely because of the portals she can set up that allow her to get from A to B as quickly as possible. This, paired with her high damage combos, makes her a great addition to any team.NamorIf you're looking to shut down and have dive potential with the same character, Namor is the perfect choice. He thrives at playing the backfield and can take pop shots at anyone he sees. Plus, setting up squids in key spots where your healers are is enough to prevent anyone from sneaking up on you.PsylockeIf you're looking for a highly mobile hero with a high damage output, Psylocke is the perfect one to play. Even though she's not necessarily a dive character, she can absolutely play like one. Perhaps the most dangerous thing about Psylocke is her ult. If you happen to catch one or two people by themselves in the backline, she can easily eliminate them.AngelaAngela is the latest hero to join the game's ever-growing cast of characters, and she's already made a big name for herself. Having a flying tank is game-changing, and what's nice is that there aren't a lot of people who can really counter her while in the air. She can be played like a dive character, but she can also take a lot of damage on the frontline thanks to her shield. Need some tips on how to play new hero Angela? Check out our detailed Angela guide.The PunisherThe Punisher has always been a solid character and fits into just about every list. Even though all of his attacks are ranged, you can still get up and close thanks to his shotgun. He's excellent at holding down areas due to his machine gun turret and ability to shut down a lot of flyers who may be in the area. Winter SoldierIt often feels like the Winter Soldier is one of Netease's favorite characters. It's hard to think of a time when he was ever bad. Like The Punisher, he can fit into any list and can fill plenty of different roles; For example, he's adept at dealing with flyers and can shut down any dives thanks to his hook attack. On top of that, his ult allows him to clear large groups all at once.Cloak & DaggerCloak & Dagger are perhaps one of the most straightforward healers to learn, and have a huge presence on the battlefield. You don't even need to hit someone with your heals; as long as you get the general area, you'll heal them. Being able to switch between characters that also assist with damage and blinding enemies is a huge bonus, too, and a well-timed ult can easily pave the way to the objective when need be.Luna SnowEven though Luna is a healer, that doesn't mean she can't dish out some damage. If, for some reason, you find yourself on the frontline, you can freeze someone to give your team some time to line up an attack. This is also a great way to fight off anyone trying to dive at her. Similar to Cloak & Dagger, her ult can guide a struggling team to touch the objective and give them a fighting chance.PhoenixHaving a Phoenix on the team is never a bad idea. Most of her attacks dish out a lot of damage, and having her in the backfield to serve as a sniper is perhaps one of the best things she can do. Plus, having her paired up with a Wolverine is a match made in heaven, and if your team happens to be giving up ground, her ult will make sure that's taken care of right away.B-Tier Marvel Rivals HeroesPeni ParkerPeni can really shine in certain situations. Specifically, when you're on defense on the Convergence map, or when you're playing Domination, her ability to set up nests and plant mines is extremely useful. These mines can easily take out one or two heroes if they're not paying attention, or at least damage another tank enough for someone else to finish the job. Plus, her ability to web characters and stun them out of an ult makes her especially dangerous.VenomWhen it comes to diving, Venom is a great character to play, but he's not the best fit in every game. You'll need at least one other diver to help, and if no one else is playing tank, you'll leave everyone on the frontline to deal with everything on their own. But don't let that deter you, because you can often buy your team enough time to run up the field if you focus on the healers and more squishy characters.HelaHaving a poke character is never a bad idea. Hela is one of the most dangerous characters in the game. She has high damage input, and her ult only amplifies that. Thankfully, Season 4 is helping her even more with the new Symbiote Shenanigans team-up. If you're looking to stop the enemy team's range characters, she's a good counter to most of them.Take a look at the best Team-Ups in Marvel Rivals Season 4!Human TorchJohnny just has a certain flair. A well-placed Human Torch can be very scary. As a flyer, he always has a good view of everything, can dish out a lot of damage, and can get away relatively fast. Although First Steps may not be the most powerful team-up, being able to drop The Thing in the backfield is enough to disrupt the backfield for your team to push up.Iron ManIron Man excels when he's paired up with the right people (Ultron, mainly). But he can also stand on his own with his kit, shooting at folks from a distance. Being able to terrorize a tank with what sometimes feels like an ultimate beam is great in just about any situation. His ult still remains one of the best in the game.Moon KnightMoon Knight has seen a lot of nerfs and buffs, but he's always been a reliable hero to have on your team for a couple of key reasons. One of them is Ankh, which allows him to damage multiple people at once and dish out a lot of damage while doing it. On top of that, his ult is a great way to clear out anyone standing on the objective.Spider-ManSpider-Man used to be an absolute menace, like J. Jonah Jameson used to claim. Even though he's seen a lot of nerfs and changes that don't make him as scary anymore, don't let that fool you because he still is, in the right hands. Being able to grab just about anyone and throw them off the map with his webs is still one of the scariest things about him, and that's without mentioning how fast he is in being able to escape any danger he might find himself in. As a healer, nothing is scarier than seeing the webbed menace coming your way.Invisible WomanInvisible Woman is an ideal pick whenever you have any of the other Fantastic Four members on your team, because her team-up allows them to heal teammates in the heat of battle on their own. On top of that, she's great at trapping divers from escaping thanks to her push ability, and if she does get caught, she can easily turn invisible and run somewhere safe. Like Cloak & Dagger and Luna Snow, her ult can make all the difference in a key fight.UltronUltron is great to have on your team, but only if you have a healer like Cloak & Dagger, Luna Snow, or Invisible Woman. This is because he can't deliver as many heals as most of them can. But he makes up for it when it comes to damage output, and this is especially true when the Stark Protocol is in play. Playing Ultron can always be a gamble because you often sacrifice heals for damage, and his ult only reflects that, which can often cost important fights. But if you can place your drones on the right characters, this can be avoided.HulkHulk can be a mixed bag at times. Even though he has a lot of mobility, it can often come at a cost. Whenever he's on the field, it often feels he's often targeted by the entire lobby. But if you're able to maintain composure, you can remind them why Hulk is the strongest there is. Similar to Thor, he can be played on the frontlines, or you can jump your way to the backfield and attempt to take out a healer or two. Even though his attacks consist of his right and left hands, they can pack a serious punch. Whenever the Gamma Charge is in play, the combo is strong enough that you're almost guaranteed to shut down dives.Iron FistIron Fist has always been a blast to play. Nothing beats jumping into the backfield and giving the enemy healer the good one-two combo. Plus, if you're good enough with him, you can easily solo just about any tank that comes your way. It's worth mentioning, though, he requires a lot of skill to play well and can die extremely fast.Captain AmericaCaptain America is a lot like Iron Fist because he's a lot of fun to play, but he's a tricky character to learn. He used to be one of the most standout tanks, but due to a series of buffs, that's sadly no longer the case. Captain America doesn't fit into a lot of builds anymore and is more of a situational tank for when you're looking to jump on the point or distract the team for a while. But if you learn how to properly play him, he can easily be one of the most dangerous heroes on the field.Squirrel GirlSquirrel Girl is often a safe pick whenever you find yourself playing on a Convergence or Domination map. It's because you can often hide someone in the corner and spam acorns, and you're almost guaranteed to get a hit. Even with her most recent nerf, she's still worth picking because of how easy she is to play.Black PantherBlack Panther has always been a character to watch out for. This is especially true thanks to the Gamma Charge team-up that he's now part of. Even though he's not as strong as he was in Season 3.5, he's still a danger on the field.Rocket RaccoonRocket Raccoon can be a challenging hero to play, but if you have a good one on your team, you'll be set up for success. This is largely due to how small he is; he's often an easy target to miss. Plus, if everyone is dead on point, he can easily run around in circles for a few seconds without being caught. Like Cloak & Dagger, you don't need to hit someone with your heals because they'll receive it as long as you shoot it in their general area. The other thing that really makes him sense is his respawn beacon that'll bring back one person as soon as they're killed. One thing you really need to be smart about, though, is where you place his ult, because of how quickly it can be destroyed. C-Tier Marvel Rivals HeroesHawkeyeHawkeye has always been a character that's hard to master, but he's gotten a little bit easier to play thanks to a series of buffs and team-ups that he's a part of. Being able to one-shot a lot of enemies with a well-placed headshot is always a good feeling. Plus, his ability to hit just about anyone with his ult is why he's not lower on this list.Mister FantasticUp until Season 3.5, Mister Fantastic was a solid pick because he could easily double as a tank if need be. Thanks to a series of nerfs, though, he's no longer as good as he used to be. But one thing he still shines at is shutting down dives, and this is thanks to his ability to hit people at a distance. So even if they are getting away, you can potentially eliminate them before they flee to safety. Star-LordPeter has had quite the journey since the game's launch. He used to be one of the best characters to play, but sadly, that's no longer the case. That being said, he can still dish out a lot of damage, and his ult can be good if there's not a shield character on the other team. That being said, there's often a lot working against him, and you're usually better off with another Duelist hero.StormSadly, Storm falls into the same category as Star-Lord. She's, by all accounts, a fun character to play, but many other flyers are more ideal than her. Even with the Jeff-Nado team-up, it's not worth having her or Jeff on the team when there are many better options to pick from. But the one thing that really makes her stand out is her ability to buff the team if they're within her radius, and at times, this can make a difference during a fight.Adam WarlockAdam Warlock has always been a risky healer to play. Like Ultron, he doesn't have many moves to heal people. The heals he does have are placed on cooldowns, and if you're not smart with them, you can easily set up your team for failure. It is worth mentioning that even though his ult is useful, if done in a poor location, it'll usually be a waste of time.MantisMantis is another healer who can be a bit of a gamble. Even though she has some useful items in her kit, like the ability to stun enemies, her healing output isn't the best. The same can be said about her ult, which often feels like a weaker version of Luna Snow's.Scarlet WitchScarlet Witch is an ideal character if you're new to the game. That being said, there are a lot of better options out there. Even though she can dish out a lot of damage, there's a lot working against her. One prime example of this is her ult, because anyone with a shield can block it, and she can be stunned out of it with Emma or Penni.D-Tier Marvel Rivals HeroesBlack WidowBlack Widow has always had a tough time in Marvel Rivals. She's easily the least powerful Duelist in the game, even with the buffs and team-ups she's received. Oftentimes, it's not worth playing her if you're looking to go poke, when other heroes like Hela do a better job than her and require less skill.Jeff the Land SharkEven though Jeff the Land Shark has a simple kit to understand, that's where a lot of his usefulness ends. He has a poor output rate as a healer, and there are often better picks than him. On top of that, his ult is less than ideal for a healer, because if you find yourself in a key battle where both healers use their ults, his will often feel like a waste and end up costing the fight.Wondering which heroes create Team-Ups when combined?

      "description": "",
      "content": "The 20th anniversary of God of War is here, and Sony made sure to celebrate the milestone at its September 2025 State of Play by revealing something special for longtime fans: a new controller.The PlayStation-maker revealed its Kratos-themed PS5 DualSense controller toward the end of its presentation today, showing off its ash-white color and blood-red mark. It’s not quite the new God of War game announcement many may have been hoping to see, but it does come with confirmation that it will launch in October for $84.99, with pre-orders opening October 3 at 10am local time.The original God of War launched for the PlayStation 2 in 2005 and quickly catapulted Kratos into becoming a PlayStation icon. The 2018 soft reboot helped the god-killer reclaim his fame while introducing fans to a new Norse setting, with its sequel, God of War Ragnarok, then arriving in 2022.The latter has received new content in the years since, with its Valhalla roguelike mode arriving as a free story update in late 2023. Outside of this, though, fans have been left waiting for any news from developer Santa Monica Studio, as the next chapter of Kratos’ journey remains a mystery.\"When we were deciding how best to embody the series, we immediately thought the form of the controller lent itself perfectly to Kratos’ omega tattoo,\" Santa Monica Studio associate art director Dela Longfish explained in a PlayStation.Blog post. \"No matter which God of War game you’re playing, the shape of his red ink against the gray of his ash-covered skin is one of the most iconic elements of Kratos’ look across both Greek and Norse sagas. Our team made sure to represent both of these key tones in the color selection for the controller to make every aspect an authentic homage to the design that has defined Kratos for over two decades.\"The God of War 20th anniversary Kratos controller is far from the first limited-edition accessory Sony has created. Past PS5 DualSense highlights include the PlayStation 30th anniversary controller, a The Last of Us controller, and a Death Stranding 2: On the Beach controller. Sony even loves Astro Bot so much that the mascot got not one but two limited edition controllers for collectors.For more, you can check out everything announced at the September 2025 State of Play or dive into our guide to every DualSense color Sony has released so far.Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

Designed for use with PlayStation 5 or a desktop PC gaming setup, the Pulse Elevate wireless speakers can also connect to a PlayStation Portal or your smartphone.The twin speakers — available in both Midnight Black and White — also feature a built-in microphone with \"AI-enhanced noise rejection\" so you can use the setup for voice chat as you play.Announced during today's State of Play broadcast, the speakers currently have just a vague 2026 release date — and there's no mention of pricing details yet either.\"Pulse Elevate is powered by PlayStation Link technology for ultra-low latency and lossless connectivity to deliver sound as it happens on compatible devices,\" wrote Edwin Foo, PlayStation's vice president of product development, in an accompanying PlayStation blog post. \"Each speaker features studio-inspired planar magnetic drivers for lifelike sound across the entire audible spectrum. This means players can hear games exactly how developers intended – whether they’re playing on PS5, PC, Mac or PlayStation Portal.\"On PS5, you'll be able to fiddle with the speakers' volume mix to adjust EQ, sidetone, volume, and mic mute settings directly via system menus. An option to do similar on PC will be available post-launch.For more, check out everything announced during State of Play September 2025 to find out what else is coming to PlayStation 5.

      "content": "Halloween, the stealth horror game based on the 1978 movie of the same name, has a gameplay reveal trailer fresh from Sony’s State of Play September 2025 broadcast. Not only that, it has a release date: September 8, 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store.IllFonic is best known for its asymmetric multiplayer horror games Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game, Friday the 13th: The Game, and Predator Hunting Grounds, but Halloween has single-player and multiplayer modes.Here’s the official blurb:Death comes to Haddonfield in Halloween, a chilling tribute to the iconic John Carpenter’s classic film. Survive or slay across the tense streets and dark corners of Haddonfield in this asymmetrical horror sandbox, taking on the role of either a desperate Civilian or the infamous Michael Myers himself. In each high-stakes cat-and-mouse match, every decision means life or death.As a Civilian, protect the townsfolk by guiding them to safety, scavenging for weapons and supplies, and finding a phone to call the police before it’s too late. Danger lurks around every corner, and survival depends on strategy, teamwork, and quick thinking. Meanwhile, Michael Myers stalks the shadows, using terrifying abilities like Shape Jump to move unseen across the map and strike without warning in a heart-pounding experience.For more, check out IGN’s interview with IllFonic on Halloween from August.

      "title": "Battlefield 6 Campaign Preview: Chaos, Destruction, and Surprising Variety",
      "description": "",
      "content": "Battlefield has always been defined by scale: sprawling maps, crumbling buildings, and squads working in sync to turn the tide of war. With Battlefield 6, Battlefield Studios is aiming to bring that same sense of chaos and unpredictability into the single-player campaign. After going hands-on with several missions, it’s clear this isn’t just a throwaway side mode – it’s a confident, varied experience that constantly shifts objectives, introduces new tools, and keeps the action fresh. From storming beaches under fire to chasing trains through collapsing tunnels, every level I played delivered a new surprise and kept me constantly excited for what I would experience next. Fearsome FoursomeThe campaign drops you into the year 2027 as part of Dagger 1-3, an elite squad of U.S. Marines. If you’ve played the recent multiplayer beta – or any Battlefield before – you’ll immediately recognize the squad archetypes. Carter fills the Assault role, Murphy handles Engineer duties, Gecko manages Recon, and Lopez rounds out the team as Support. Curiously, Lopez isn’t playable in the campaign, and Battlefield Studios declined to elaborate when asked why. Whether it’s a design choice or a story reveal saved for later, time will tell. What makes the campaign stand out so far is how it blends traditional FPS action with light squad management. Each mission hands you a different Marine, but you’re rarely operating alone. You can call on your squadmates mid-fight to use their specialized abilities – Gecko tagging targets, Murphy blowing open defenses, Lopez keeping everyone supplied and revived. It’s not a deep tactical system, but it makes your squad feel integral to success, and it adds a dynamic layer that’s genuinely fun.What makes the campaign stand out so far is how it blends traditional FPS action with light squad management.The small touches sell the squad dynamic even further. Take out an enemy gunner, and your Marine calls out, “MG down!” Drop an engineer, and suddenly you know their SAM launcher is no longer a threat. These callouts double as gameplay feedback, helping you adjust tactics mid-fight. Even in single-player, the firefights carry the tension and layered pacing of multiplayer matches, with squads clashing and roles countering one another. It’s exactly the kind of squad-driven storytelling Battlefield fans have long hoped for.Buckle Up and Hang OnDuring my hands-on, I had access to three missions scattered across the campaign, and it was immediately obvious why these were chosen. Each mission felt completely different, with objectives that constantly changed the pace and approach. These three levels honestly felt closer to nine, and I had to remind myself partway through missions that I was still in that same level. `The first one I played was Operation Gladius, the third stage in the story. It opens with an iconic “war-game” spectacle: storming enemy beaches inside an armored vehicle. From the moment it began, I was floored by the presentation. Mud and smoke obscured my vision while explosions rocked the shoreline. The waves sent our floating tanks rocking back and forth, while a hazy, smoke-filled sky gave me a preview of the battle I was heading into. As the gunner, I was tasked with taking out bunkers and enemy troops, and what could have been a straightforward turret section became a tense scramble to see through debris and support my squad.Once the tanks landed, I, still playing as Murphy the Engineer, began escorting a tank through a war-torn town toward City Hall. This section leaned into classic Battlefield gameplay: waves of enemies, constant destruction, all while keeping the tank operational, while Lopez resupplied and revived me. Gecko tagged threats from a distance, and Carter and I pushed the front line while entire buildings, balconies, and trees collapsed around us. For stretches, it felt like playing multiplayer condensed into an intense single-player package.The town itself kept me on my toes. Enemies poured out of alleys, rooftops, and damaged buildings, but the destruction turned unpredictability into opportunity. Snipers hiding behind cover could be flushed out with grenades or RPGs, and alternate flanking routes allowed me to approach firefights in multiple ways. The level design rewards thinking like a Battlefield player: if the enemy can occupy a space, so can you.The mission culminated in a massive push on City Hall, reminiscent of defending a hard-won capture point in multiplayer. My squad and I held the line against relentless waves while clearing buildings and mopping up remaining enemies. The chaos of the finale mirrored the opening sequence, cementing the sense that the campaign isn’t afraid to keep objectives moving, destruction constant, and action relentless.A Great ScriptThe other missions I got to play further reinforced this variety. Mission five began with a tense apartment sweep, clearing floors with my squad while using a sledgehammer to break dow n walls. The shootouts were intense and had me checking my corners diligently as my thermal scope helped me spot the pesky PAX in the dimly lit apartment building. This section ended with a shootout between apartment buildings – a bit of a shooting gallery moment as I waited for enemies to pop up so I could take them down, but still enjoyable nonetheless. Going underground, the squad and I continued to pick off enemies in smoke and dirt-filled tunnels. Luckily, my thermal-scoped rifle was still in my hands, or this mission would've been much tougher. The mission then pivoted hard into a high-speed car chase through subway tunnels. While one of the more scripted moments of my entire preview, it was still fun to live through the spectacle, even if I felt like I didn’t have much control over what was happening. After a short jaunt through a construction site, the mission reaches its big explosive moment by blowing up New York’s Brooklyn Bridge. The once intact bridge then becomes the final stretch of this mission, as I was then tasked to make my way through the rubble to disable some transmitters. While completely in shambles, I never found myself lost as I made my way through the bridge, and instead got to take in a Levolution moment in a single-player campaign. Again, I know it’s a scripted set piece, but blasting my way through the ruins still felt like an organic way to push the intense moments of the story further. Overall, the fifth mission once again proved that Battlefield Studios is looking to up the ante every moment they can. Room to RoamMission eight was easily my favorite. Instead of tight corridors, it opened into a semi-open map that gave me room to experiment. Playing as Gecko, the Recon, I had a bomb-dropping drone and a vehicle I could hop in and out of at will. Jumping into a Jeep with my squad beside me immediately brought back Halo vibes, marking the first mission I played that genuinely felt like I could set my own pace. The initial objective was to take out a few SAM sites, and from what I could tell, it seemed like I could approach them in any order – though my limited playtime didn’t let me fully test that freedom.The sense of choice made the mission really enjoyable. I wasn’t funneled into predetermined vantage points, so it was up to me to drive around and find good positions for my squad to post up and take down enemies. The drone added a whole new layer of strategy. I could get a bird’s-eye view of the battlefield to scout and mark enemies, then rain bombs down until the enemy spotted and destroyed my drone, which would trigger a brief cooldown before I could deploy it again.Firing missiles from a first-person perspective to take down helicopters and tanks was incredibly satisfying.The objectives escalated quickly, moving from taking out SAM sites to guiding rockets with the Switchblade system against waves of enemies. Honestly, this part was awesome – I’ll take more Switchblade missions, please. Firing missiles from a first-person perspective to take down helicopters and tanks was incredibly satisfying, and it honestly makes me want a mini-game just for that mechanic.The mission wrapped up with a climactic firefight across a dam, the drone continuing to add another chaotic layer while letting me choose how to approach combat. There’s even a Battlefield version of a boss encounter, where an enemy helicopter circles the dam and needs to be taken down. This mission isn’t as explosively over-the-top as some of the others, but the freedom it offers makes it stand out, and it still includes some epic set pieces that are genuinely fun to experience.After playing these missions, it’s clear that Battlefield 6’s campaign isn’t filler. Battlefield Studios is taking what makes multiplayer memorable – destruction, unpredictable firefights, and meaningful squad dynamics – and trying to translate it into single-player form. And so far, they seem to be right on target. Whether I was storming beaches, chasing trains, or raining fire from a drone, the campaign consistently kept me on my toes and surprised me with new objectives and moments of spectacle. If the full release keeps this momentum, Battlefield 6 could finally deliver a single-player experience worthy of the series’ scale and intensity – something we arguably haven’t seen since the Bad Company days.",

      "description": "",
      "content": "As part of its exclusive GeForce Week event, Walmart is currently offering amazing deals on three prebuilt gaming systems all equipped with the GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card. Prices start at just $1,099, although arguably the best deal may be the model with the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU for $100 more. I think these deals are as good as the ones we will see during Black Friday. They're also all sold and shipped from Walmart direct and not a marketplace vendor.The GeForce RTX 5070 GPU is an excellent choice for 1080p or 1440p gamingCompared to the previous generation GPUs, the RTX 5070 performs a bit better than the RTX 4070 Super. I wish there was a bigger generation improvement in raw performance, but the RTX 5070 is still a superior graphics card because it supports DLSS 4 and has 12GB of the newer GDDR7 VRAM on top of the slight performance improvement. You probably won't even find an RTX 4070 Super gaming PC for less than $1,100, either. The RTX 5070 is a popular GPU for 1080p or 1440 gaming. The next card up - the RTX 5070 Ti - is significantly more expensive and really for gamers who want high fps 1440p or 4K gaming. Anything less demanding and it's probably overkill.

These deals are, frankly, so good that they're worth picking up before Black Friday.

      "description": "",
      "content": "For decades now, the Microsoft Flight Simulator franchise has been associated with Microsoft's own DOS/Windows operating systems and, more recently, Xbox consoles (weird exceptions like this 1986 Macintosh port notwithstanding). However, that era seems set to end as Sony announced during this evening's State of Play livestream that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will come to the PlayStation 5 on December 8. No, that's not a typo. Credit: Sony The move isn't entirely shocking for modern Microsoft, which has been publishing previous Xbox exclusives on competing consoles in increasing numbers for a while now. And Flight Simulator 2024 has been available on Xbox Series S/X for almost a year now, as the name suggests, giving Xbox owners a \"timed exclusive\" at least. Still, it's a bit striking to see a franchise that literally has the Microsoft brand name integrated into its title moving to a major non-Microsoft platform like this. The impact is a little bit like seeing a Sonic game on a Nintendo console for the first time in 2001, after years of Sega selling itself as the anti-Nintendo.Read full article Comments",

It comes with a trailer, teasing a re-release for a classic that is only a few months away from launch.Aspyr calls Deus Ex Remastered the \"definitive version\" of Ion Storm's original immersive sim. Although exact details on all of the changes have yet to be revealed, the studio promises players can look forward to \"visual upgrades, modern enhancements, and quality-of-life improvements.\"\"The year is 2052,\" an official description of Deus Ex Remastered's story says. \"Societies are teetering on collapse, plagues spread unchecked, and shadow governments shape the future. You are JC Denton—a nano-augmented UNATCO operative tasked with protecting order. But the deeper you dig, the more lies you uncover.

      "description": "",
      "content": "Sony has finally pulled back the curtain on its hotly anticipated PlayStation 5-exclusive Wolverine video game during its State of Play September 2025 showcase.From Insomniac, the developer of the hugely popular Spider-Man video games, Marvel's Wolverine is a gory affair in keeping with the veteran X–Men superhero's skillset, but much darker and more brutal than you might expect from Insomniac. It's due out fall 2026.The action-packed trailer, below, reveals characters Omega Red and Mystique, as well as a face-off against a mutant-hunting Sentinel. Locations include the Canadian wilderness, Tokyo, and Madrapoor. Liam Mcintyre, JD Fenix from Gears, plays Logan/Wolverine in the game.Insomniac said it will show more of Wolverine in the spring of 2026.In a post on the PlayStation Blog, Aaron Jason Espinoza, Senior Community Manager, Insomniac Games, teased the story and revealed the Wolverine cover art, which you can view in the slideshow of images, below.\"Independence is often the way of Wolverine, although keen-eyed fans may have spotted some of the familiar faces he’ll encounter on his journey, like the elusive Mystique or the brutish Omega Red. Some will fight alongside Logan against all odds and others will unleash all-out attacks on our hero, such as the Reavers, one of our enemy factions, who will keep our hero’s instincts on edge. Speaking of which, our trailer concludes with a prototype of an iconic-yet-menacing purple robot. \"In this global thriller, Wolverine’s search for answers will send him on perilous excursions to exotic locales, including the island nation of Madripoor, the frosted wilderness of Canada, and the narrow city streets of Tokyo – all potential battlegrounds for fierce, bloody, destructive action.\"We’d heard nothing official on Wolverine since its reveal in 2021, save a shift in leadership reported in October 2024. Previous creative director Brian Horton jumped ship to Xbox as the new creative director for Perfect Dark, which was being co-developed by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics before Microsoft canceled the game.Unofficially, early Wolverine footage and information emerged from data stolen from Insomniac in December 2023.Be sure to check out everything announced during State of Play September 2025 to find out what else is coming to PlayStation 5.Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

      "content": "EA has revealed a first look at the Battlefield 6 single-player campaign during Sony’s State of Play September 2025 broadcast.The video, below, shows suitably explosive action, the series’ trademark destruction, and intense cutscenes.In a post on the PlayStation Blog, Roman Campos-Oriola, Creative Director, Single Player, said the Battlefield 6 campaign \"is a white knuckle thrill ride that has you playing various members of Dagger 13, an elite Marine Raiders unit determined to stop Pax Armata, a private military corporation seeking to reshape global power as NATO teeters on the edge of collapse.\"He continued: \"After the War Stories episode structure of Battlefield 1 and Battlefield V, Battlefield 6 is a return to a singular narrative, one that has you fighting battles across three continents. During this campaign, you’ll fight a tank battle under the shadows of the Pyramids, take to the streets of Brooklyn for intense gunfights, perform a HALO jump into enemy territory, and more in this modern military thriller.\"Along the way, you’ll assume the role of members of Dagger 13, confronting inner and outer turmoil as they seek to accomplish their mission.\"True to Battlefield, your squad is the key to accomplishing your mission in Single Player. You’ll be able to command the rest of Dagger 13 to engage enemy forces as a group in order to suppress them as you reposition to snipe, flank them, or take out multiple foes with a well-thrown grenade. Additionally, as you step into the well-worn boots of different members of the squad, you’ll be able to take advantage of their respective abilities and talents to gain the upper hand when engaging the enemy.\"Battlefield 6’s Single Player and Multiplayer take place in an interconnected world, with Dagger 13’s mission taking them to locales and battles that players will be experiencing in the series’ iconic All-Out Warfare multiplayer modes, where NATO’s remaining forces wage war against Pax Armata.\"Battlefield 6 is due out October 10, 2025.Be sure to check out everything announced during State of Play September 2025 to find out what else is coming to PlayStation 5.Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

      "description": "",
      "content": "Sony kicked off its September 2025 State of Play by announcing a March 20, 2026, release date for developer Housemarque’s Returnal follow-up on PlayStation 5, Saros.Creative director Gregory Louden talked fans through some of the changes to Returnal’s story-driven roguelike formula when the extended look at gameplay that premiered today. While the breakneck, bullet-hell action the original game is known for seems to be back for Saros, we also got to see new features, including the Second Chance feature, the Soltari Shield, and Power Weapons.Louden took to the PlayStation.Blog to dive even deeper into the story of Arjun Devraj (Rohul Kohli) and how Housemarque has evolved Returnal's gameplay. The creative director confirms that the footage was captured on a PS5 at 60fps using Unreal Engine 5. Saros is still in development, so Louden reminds fans to expect various tweaks and other changes before that March release date arrives.The post describes Saros' new setting, Carcosa, as a \"shape-shifting, hostile alien planet.\" That's nothing new to players who ventured through Returnal's Atropos, but this time around, Housemarque will try a new strategy when it comes to telling its story.\"Along with grounded voice-over, stunning cinematics, haunting audio logs, and conversations with our ensemble cast of NPCs,\" Louden said, \"there are also Soltari Holograms detailing what happened on Carcosa as you explore. If you choose to collect them, they are vital to discover what happened on this hostile planet.\"Music played an important role in Returnal, so it's no surprise to hear Housemarque taking steps to do so again in Saros. Louden says the \"dark-electronic meets drone-metal score\" for the footage we've seen thus far was composed by Joker and Chernobyl's Sam Slater. He's also known for his work on 2021's Candyman and Battlefield 2042.Be sure to read up on everything announced at the September 2025 State of Play while we wait for more Saros news from Housemarque. You can also check out the project's original reveal from earlier this year.Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

      "content": "Texas officials are telling residents to check their pets and livestock, and insisting on immediate use of pesticide bait after officials in Mexico confirmed an infection with the flesh-eating New World Screwworm (NWS) less than 70 miles from the US border. NWS is a horrifying parasitic fly that attacks warm-blooded animals, laying hundreds of eggs in any openings or wounds, even minute ones. The resulting larvae both look and act like screws, boring and twisting into the animal while feasting on its living flesh. The ravenous larvae create ghastly wounds that can be deadly to livestock and wild animals. Long ago, this ferocious fly was endemic in the US and stymied the livestock industry. However, in the 1950s, eradication efforts using sterile male flies and livestock monitoring began to push the fly population southward. By around 1966, it was cleared from the US, and Mexico zapped the population in the 1980s. By 2006, it was pushed out of Central America, with Panama declaring it eradicated and holding the flies at bay at the Darién Gap at the border with Colombia. However, in 2022, the gap was breached, and the flies have been steadily moving northward.Read full article Comments",

      "title": "Marvel Zombies Ending Explained",
      "description": "",
      "content": "FULL SPOILERS ahead for Marvel Zombies!All four episodes of the new limited series Marvel Zombies are now available to watch on Disney+ – read IGN’s Marvel Zombies review – which means we can fully unpack the ending of this What IfI? spin-off. And what an ending it was. It’s so bleak it makes the ending of Avengers: Infinity War seem upbeat. “Point to the zombie movie that has a happy ending,” as executive producer Brad Winderbaum put it to me in a recent interview. More from him later.Marvel Zombies picks up after the events depicted in the fifth episode of What If…? Season 1, where Earth is ravaged by a zombie apocalypse just as Thanos arrives looking for the final Infinity Stone. Unlike in Infinity War, though, Thanos – along with most of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes – is turned into a zombie. At the end of that episode, Bruce Banner/Hulk apparently sacrificed himself by remaining behind to battle an evil Wanda Maximoff and her zombie army while the surviving heroes escaped to Wakanda. But Marvel Zombies reveals that’s not quite what happened…Marvel Zombies Ending ExplainedIn Marvel Zombies, Episode 3, Kamala Khan, Blade Knight, Shang-Chi, Katy, Red Guardian, Jimmy Woo, Death Dealer, and Baron Zemo arrive in New Asgard seeking the use of an Asgardian spaceship so that Kamala’s transmitter can send a signal for help to the Nova Corps. Once inside the fortress walls, they discover Wanda, now in her human form despite last being seen as a zombie, is there as a guest of Valkyrie and Thor. Wanda explains that over time, she used her powers to heal herself and sculpt reality. She says the Wakanda Event – where T’Challa sacrificed his life to destroy Thanos and his Infinity Stones – released massive energies from the destroyed Infinity Stones. Wanda claims she could harness those energies to heal the world, “but someone stole it for themselves. They hoard it.” Kamala has seen this figure in her dreams. Wanda says that she can’t defeat him on her own. She needs an army, “soldiers with the strengths of gods.”But (shock!) Wanda deceives our heroes, fatally poisoning the Asgardians during a banquet and turning them into the latest members of her zombie horde. “Kamala, don’t be afraid,” Wanda tells the young superhero. “Come with me. Together, we can fix this.” Kamala thinks Wanda wants the transmitter, but it’s actually Ms. Marvel herself and the power she wields that the Queen of the Dead wants. By the end of the third episode, the only surviving heroes are Kamala, Blade Knight, Valkyrie, Shang-Chi, and Katy. Even the Mighty Thor appears to have perished while holding off Wanda and her zombies long enough for his comrades to escape in a spaceship. Sadly, it turns out the Nova Corps will not help them and have, in fact, quarantined Earth as it poses a threat to the rest of the galaxy. In the season finale, the surviving Avengers are magically sent to Kamar-Taj where they are greeted by Spider-Man and Scott Lang (now just a floating head in a glass helmet but able to fly thanks to Doctor Strange’s cloak). The sorcerers Rintrah, Sara and the London Master have provided them with shelter. The sorcerers explain that Bruce Banner isn’t dead. The Hulk was the only being on Earth whose form could withstand and hold all of that Infinity Stone energy and prevent it from destroying all life. He is no longer Banner or Hulk but rather “a cipher, an anchor protecting energies that could make or destroy worlds.”Wanda finally has an army strong enough to confront Banner and take that infinite power from him. The sorcerers need all the help they can get, so that’s why they brought the Avengers to Kamar-Taj. They know it’s their last stand against Wanda.During the final battle, Wanda tempts Kamala to join forces with her to help rob (let’s call him) Infinite Hulk of the energy he holds: “Kamala, help me. I’m trying to save you all. Can’t you see? … If you stop me, all this is for nothing. Would you have your friends die for nothing? If you stop me, Kate and Riri would have died for nothing. You are blind to your own salvation. If I can’t convince you, maybe your friends can.”That’s when a zombified Red Guardian, Kate Bishop and Riri Williams attack Kamala. As this happens, Infinite Hulk kills a zombified Thor. Then Wanda appears before Hulk and touches him, the one thing our heroes had to prevent her from doing. Wanda starts to absorb Hulk’s Infinite Energy. The Avengers and sorcerers perish trying to stop Wanda. Only Kamala remains. Wanda once again adopts her human guise to make a final plea to Kamala: “We were meant to be here. To end this together. … I’m too strong for you, Kamala. But still not strong enough to save us. I need you. … We can fix this. You can help me bring them all back. Kamala, look around. The suffering. Save them. Take my hand. All will be made whole. You can still save the world, like you always wanted.” “I’m sorry,” Kamala sobs. “This can’t all be for nothing.” Then she takes Wanda’s hand as the Queen of the Dead declares, “And so the world begins again.”One massive energy burst later and Kamala awakens back home in New Jersey. Her mother’s voice calls to her that her friends are at the door. Kamala rushes downstairs to find her besties Kate and Riri, alive and well. Kamala is beyond overjoyed to see them, who have no idea why she’s so excited. Only Kamala has memories of the zombie apocalypse. The three friends go out for boba, where Kamala rattles off all the things she wants to do next. While she’s checking out a guy across the street, Kamala starts to see sudden bursts of zombies pulsing through her perceived reality. The normal people she sees are, in fact, still zombies.A still-living Riri (remember, she injected herself with an experimental drug earlier in the season before she appeared to perish) is battling zombies, calling out to Kamala, telling her that none of the normal, happy life she’s seeing is real. Yes, it’s all a Wanda-fied illusion. “Kamala, are you good?,” Kate asks. Kamala’s face is frozen. The screen cuts to black for a moment. The final shot of Marvel Zombies is a close-up of a hissing zombie Wanda. Kamala Khan – who always wanted to be a superhero like her idol Captain Marvel – has failed her friends and the world. The Queen of the Dead has prevailed.\"Point to the zombie movie that has a happy ending.Why Marvel Zombies Had to End That Way“I mean, we were making a zombie movie, really. Point to the zombie movie that has a happy ending,” Brad Winderbaum told IGN in a recent interview. Indeed, the works of George A. Romero bear that out, beginning with the grandaddy of all downbeat zombie movie endings, Night of the Living Dead.Winderbaum said that from his initial conversations with series creators Bryan Andrews and Zeb Wells, it was always the plan for Marvel Zombies to be a journey that ended with the protagonists losing.“There were two things Bryan, Zeb and I talked about early on, and that was that this was going to be a zombie movie, and that meant kind of a general quest structure at times and a story about survival,” Winderbaum explained. “And not just, will these characters or won't they survive, but also in surviving, will that change them and will it corrupt them? And we pointed to some of our favorite zombie movies where that is a central theme.” “Also, a lot of John Carpenter movies have that theme as well. They have a survival element, but it's really about, will the person change? It's one thing to survive, but will you survive intact, mentally intact? So that was important to us. So the bleakness of the world, but also the harshness of the ending was something that was always, we were chasing from the beginning.”Marvel Zombies: Season 2?But is this really the end of Marvel Zombies? Is there a chance that Kamala, with Riri’s help, could undo the damage she caused and topple Wanda in a potential second season?“Bryan and I will sometimes just talk casually and start geeking out on the lore of this universe. I think it's bigger than just this story. I think there's more stories to tell. There's certainly characters on the field that we weren't able to pull into this one adventure,” Winderbaum said.A second season could also answer what exactly that concoction was that Riri injected herself with that allowed her to survive the zombies. “We have ideas about what that is,” Winderbaum hinted.Winderbaum, who serves as Marvel Studios’ Head of Streaming, Television and Animation at Marvel Studios, was candid about the chances of a second season for Marvel Zombies, leaving it up to the fans and viewers to help make that happen.“We would love to make a Season Two. We could start right now on a Season Two. But frankly, that depends on people subscribing to Disney+ and watching the series. In success, we will, the next day we'll start working on it. So hopefully people love it as much as we do and they watch it.”“We created an ending that was less about, ‘Well, you got to see the next one,’” Winderbaum added. “Bryan compares it to the end of John Carpenter's The Thing, where there is an open question still at the end of that story, even though the story is concluded, and that was kind of the vibe we were going for there.”What did you think of the ending of Marvel Zombies and the season overall? What would you like to see happen in a second season if that happens? Let us know in the comments.",

      "title": "NASA Awards Company to Attempt Swift Spacecraft Orbit Boost",
      "description": "",
      "content": "NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, shown in this artist’s concept, orbits Earth as it studies the ever-changing universe.Credit: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center Conceptual Image Lab Driving rapid innovation in the American space industry, NASA has awarded Katalyst Space Technologies of Flagstaff, Arizona, a contract to raise a spacecraft's orbit. Katalyst’s robotic servicing spacecraft will rendezvous with NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and raise it to a higher altitude, demonstrating a key capability for the future of space exploration and extending the Swift mission’s science lifetime. NASA’s Swift launched in 2004 to explore the universe’s most powerful explosions, called gamma-ray bursts. The spacecraft’s low Earth orbit has been decaying gradually, which happens to satellites over time. However, because of recent increases in the Sun’s activity, Swift is experiencing more atmospheric drag than anticipated, speeding up its orbital decay. While NASA could have allowed the observatory to reenter Earth’s atmosphere, as many missions do at the end of their lifetimes, Swift’s lowering orbit presents an opportunity to advance American spacecraft servicing technology. “This industry collaboration to boost Swift’s orbit is just one of many ways NASA works for the nation every day,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters in Washington. “By moving quickly to pursue innovative commercial solutions, we’re further developing the space industry and strengthening American space leadership. This daring mission also will demonstrate our ability to go from concept to implementation in less than a year — a rapid-response capability important for our future in space as we send humans back to the Moon under the Artemis campaign, to Mars, and beyond.” The orbit boost is targeted for spring 2026, though NASA will continue to monitor any changes in solar activity that may impact this target timeframe. A successful Swift boost would be the first time a commercial robotic spacecraft captures a government satellite that is uncrewed, or not originally designed to be serviced in space. “Given how quickly Swift’s orbit is decaying, we are in a race against the clock, but by leveraging commercial technologies that are already in development, we are meeting this challenge head-on,” said Shawn Domagal-Goldman, acting director, Astrophysics Division, NASA Headquarters. “This is a forward-leaning, risk-tolerant approach for NASA. But attempting an orbit boost is both more affordable than replacing Swift’s capabilities with a new mission, and beneficial to the nation — expanding the use of satellite servicing to a new and broader class of spacecraft.” Swift leads NASA’s fleet of space telescopes in studying changes in the high-energy universe. When a rapid, sudden event takes place in the cosmos, Swift serves as a “dispatcher,” providing critical information that allows other “first responder” missions to follow up to learn more about how the universe works. For more than two decades, Swift has led NASA’s missions in providing new insights on these events, together broadening our understanding of everything from exploding stars, stellar flares, and eruptions in active galaxies, to comets and asteroids in our own solar system and high-energy lightning events on Earth. NASA has awarded Katalyst $30 million to move forward with implementation under a Phase III award as an existing participant in NASA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program, managed by the agency’s Space Technology Mission Directorate. This approach allowed NASA to pursue an orbit boost for Swift on a shorter development timeline than would otherwise be possible, given the rapid rate at which Swift’s orbit is decaying. “America’s space economy is brimming with cutting-edge solutions, and opportunities like this allow NASA to tap into them for real-world challenges,” said Clayton Turner, associate administrator, NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters. “Orbital decay is a common, natural occurrence for satellites, and this collaboration may open the door to extending the life of more spacecraft in the future. By working with industry, NASA fosters rapid, agile technology development, advancing capabilities to benefit the missions of today and unlock the discoveries of tomorrow.”  The NASA SBIR program is part of America’s Seed Fund, the nation’s largest source of early-stage, non-dilutive funding for innovative technologies. Through this program, entrepreneurs, startups, and small businesses with less than 500 employees can receive funding and non-monetary support to build, mature, and commercialize their technologies, advancing NASA missions and helping solve important challenges facing our country. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the Swift mission in collaboration with Penn State, the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, and Northrop Grumman Space Systems in Dulles, Virginia. Other partners include the UK Space Agency, University of Leicester and Mullard Space Science Laboratory in the United Kingdom, Brera Observatory in Italy, and the Italian Space Agency.

      "description": "",
      "content": "Doomed Egyptian queen Cleopatra has captured the imaginations of people all over the world for centuries. Archaeologists have long sought to locate her tomb, which she shared with her lover, Mark Antony, per popular legend. Thus far, the search has been unsuccessful, although many believe she would have been buried near the royal palace in Alexandria, Egypt. National Geographic explorer Kathleen Martinez thinks she might be on the verge of locating Cleopatra's final resting place at a site called Taposiris Magna. Her 20-year journey (and counting) to prove her hypothesis—and the exciting new discovery of a submerged ancient port several miles off the Mediterranean shore that was likely once part of that temple—are chronicled in Cleopatra's Final Secret, a new documentary film from National Geographic. Martinez has a degree in archaeology but initially became a criminal lawyer. She brought that legal training to bear on the question of the location of Cleopatra's tomb, treating it as she would a forensic case. \"I tried to understand her personality, who were her friends, who were her enemies,\" Martinez told Ars. \"She was a strategist and she always had a Plan A and a Plan B.\" It simply made sense to her that Cleopatra would have brought that same strategic thinking to orchestrating her death. Martinez suggested that the queen arranged for loyal subjects to transport her body through secret tunnels to a hidden final resting place.Read full article Comments",

      "description": "",
      "content": "Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards are dropping back down in price, and fortunately that means prebuilt gaming PCs are becoming more affordable as well. As part of a Walmart exclusive GeForce Week event that runs through September 28, you can pick up an Acer Nitro 60 gaming PC featuring an AMD Ryzen 9 CPU and GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU for just $1,499 with free delivery. This is one of the lowest prices I've seen for a well-equipped 5070 Ti prebuilt with a generous amount of RAM and SSD storage out of the box.Acer Nitro 60 GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC for $1,499The Acer Nitro 60 gaming PC is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 7900 processor, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti graphics card, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 2TB PCIe Gen 4 M.2 SSD. The AMD Ryzen 9 7900 CPU has a max turbo frequency of 5.4GHz with 12 cores, 24 threads, and a 64MB L2 cache. In terms of gaming performance, this CPU is neck and neck with the Intel Core i7-14700K. This is a great CPU for both gaming and producitivity use.The RTX 5070 Ti GPU Has Excellent 4K Gaming PerformanceOf all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. Like all Blackwell cards, the RTX 5070 Ti supports DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation. This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution. If you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti may be a better value since it has the same amount of VRAM as the RTX 5080.Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU Review\"At $749, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is the best 4K graphics card for most people, delivering much better value than either the RTX 5080 or 5090. Across my entire test suite, this GPU soared at 4K, coming within striking distance of much more expensive graphics cards, and that’s before taking multi frame generation into account, which will make the RTX 5070 Ti even better at hitting extremely high framerates, albeit with a hit to latency.\"Walmart GeForce Week: The Best Gaming PC DealsTrending dealsAcer Nitro 60 AMD Ryzen 9 7900 RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC for $1,499Acer Nitro 60 AMD Ryzen 7 7700 RTX 5070 Gaming PC for $1,099iBuypower Element Pro AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D RTX 5070 Gaming PC for $1,199Starting now and running through September 28, Walmart is hosting an exclusive \"GeForce Week\" sale with some astoundingly good deals on prebuilt gaming PCs featuring Nvidia's new GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs. These deals are, frankly, so good that they're worth picking up before Black Friday. This sale appears to be run by Walmart so you probably won't find these deals anywhere else (unless another retailer price matches).

      "description": "",
      "content": "Much to President Trump's dismay, Jimmy Kimmel returned to TV last night. In a wide-ranging monologue met with near-constant applause, Kimmel discussed the comments that got him suspended and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr's attempts to silence speech the president doesn't like. \"Brendan Carr is the most embarrassing car Republicans have embraced since this one, and that's saying something,\" Kimmel said, showing a photo of a Tesla Cybertruck painted with the American flag and the word \"Trump\" in big, gold letters. Carr justified his threats to Disney by saying the FCC has to uphold the public interest standard applied to broadcasters with licenses to use the public airwaves. Carr's stance is the opposite held by previous FCC chairs from both major parties, who said the FCC should uphold the free speech rights of broadcasters.Read full article Comments",

      "content": "(Top) NASA astronaut Anne McClain performs the first series of tests of an Astrobee robot, Bumble, during a hardware checkout in May, 2019. (Bottom) NASA astronaut McClain poses with Astrobee robots Bumble (left) and Honey during their latest on orbit activity in May, 2025. NASA NASA is continuing the Astrobee mission through a collaboration with Arkisys, Inc., of Los Alamitos, California, who was awarded a reimbursable Space Act Agreement to sustain and maintain the robotic platform aboard the International Space Station. As the agency returns astronauts to the Moon, robotic helpers like Astrobee could one day take over routine maintenance tasks and support future spacecraft at the Moon and Mars without relying on humans for continuous operation. In March, the agency issued a call for partnership proposals to support its ongoing space research initiatives. Arkisys was selected to maintain the platform and continue enabling partners to use the Astrobee system as a means to experiment with new technologies in the microgravity environment of the space station. NASA launched the Astrobee mission to the space station in 2018. Since then, the free-flying robots have marked multiple first-in-space milestones for robots working alongside astronauts to accomplish spacecraft monitoring, alert simulations, and more in partnership with researchers from industry and academia. The Astrobee system includes three colorful, cube-shaped robots – named “Bumble,” “Honey,” and “Queen” – along with software and a docking station for recharging. The mission has advanced NASA’s goal of developing robotic systems and technologies that can perform tasks and support exploration, maintenance, and monitoring as humans venture further into space for longer durations. The International Space Station is a convergence of science, technology, and human innovation enabling research not possible on Earth. For nearly 25 years, NASA has supported a continuous U.S. human presence aboard the orbiting laboratory, where astronauts have learned to live and work in space for extended periods of time. The space station is a springboard for developing a low Earth economy and NASA’s next great leaps in human exploration at the Moon and Mars.",

The eBay seller \"Pezz's INC\" has listed a \"like new\" (new but opened) copy of Mario Kart World for just $54.25 with free shipping. This game normally costs $79 new. This is the best price I've seen for a domestic (non-imported) version of the game. The seller seems to be legitimate with 300,000 feedback and a 99.9% rating. There are also positive reviews from people who bought the game from this listing.Mario Kart World for $54.25Currently there are only two original first party games released for the Switch 2 console: Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza. Mario Kart World is a completely new addition to the MK series, with the last new entry being Mario Kart 8 way back in 2014. Mario Kart Word's biggest updates include a completely open world design with interconnected tracks, a big and boisterous \"Knockout Tour\" multiplayer mode, and a massive visual overhaul that looks great on a 4K TV. Logan Plant reviewed Mario Kart World and wrote that \"Mario Kart World may not make the most convincing case that going open-world was the boost the series needed, but excellent multiplayer racing, incredible polish, and the thrilling new Knockout Tour mode still more than live up to its legacy.\"How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.

Link is a pilot for small uncrewed aircraft systems at the center’s Dale Reed Subscale Flight Research Laboratory and Hall is the chief pilot.NASA/Christopher LC Clark NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, is building a new subscale aircraft to support increasingly complex flight research, offering a more flexible and cost-effective alternative to crewed missions. The aircraft is being built by Justin Hall, chief pilot at NASA Armstrong’s Dale Reed Subscale Flight Research Laboratory, and Justin Link, a small uncrewed aircraft pilot. The duo is replacing the center’s aging MicroCub subscale aircraft with a more capable platform that will save time and reduce costs. The new aircraft spans about 14 feet from wingtip to wingtip, measures nine-and-a-half feet long, and weighs about 60 pounds. The subscale laboratory accelerates innovation by using small, remotely piloted aircraft to test and evaluate new aerodynamic concepts, technologies, and flight control systems. Named after aerospace pioneer Dale Reed, the lab enables rapid prototyping and risk reduction before transitioning to full-scale or crewed flight testing. Its work plays a key role in increasing technology readiness to support NASA’s missions on Earth and beyond. Hall and Link are modifying an existing subscale aircraft kit by adding a more powerful engine, an autopilot system, instrumentation, and a reinforced structure. The aircraft will offer greater flexibility for flight experiments, enabling more frequent and affordable testing compared to crewed aircraft. One example of its potential is the Robust Autonomous Aerial Recapture project, which uses sensors and video with advanced programming to learn and adapt for mid-air capture. The system relies on a magnetic connection mechanism integrated onto the two aircraft. This capability could support future science missions in which a mothership deploys drones to collect samples, recharge, and redeploy for additional missions, saving fuel, reducing cost, and increasing efficiency. Aerial recapture work is funded by the NASA Armstrong Center Innovation Fund and the Space Technology Mission Directorate.

Credit: NASA/Shawn Serbin Magic is in the air. No wait… MAGEQ is in the air, featuring scientists from NASA centers across the country who teamed up with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the University of Maryland Baltimore County, and several other university and government partners and collaborators. This summer, six planes collectively flew more than 400 hours over the mid-Atlantic United States with a goal of gathering data on a range of objectives, including air quality, forestry, and fire management. This was part of an effort called MAGEQ, short for Mid-Atlantic Gas Emissions Quantification. Rather than one mission, MAGEQ consists of several individual missions across more than a dozen organizations and agencies, along with university students. Over the course of around six weeks, aircraft flew over cities, wetlands, farms, and coal mining areas. NASA Goddard’s G-LiHT flying on the A90 flies over the Chesapeake Bay near the Big Annemessex River. Credit: NASA/Shawn Serbin “Each aircraft team is comprised of highly skilled and motivated people who understand how to fly their particular plane to achieve the science they want,” said Glenn Wolfe, research scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and project lead for MAGEQ. “The complexity comes in identifying how each platform can complement or supplement the others.” Coordinating flights required both advanced planning and flexibility to get the best outcome. Weather proved to be a primary challenge for the team, as members worked around cloudy days, wind, and storms to ensure safe flights. The six aircraft had different objectives and requirements. For example, some carried instruments that needed to fly high to simulate a satellite’s view of the atmosphere and the Earth’s surface and could not measure through clouds. Others were equipped with instruments that directly measured the air particles and could work under the clouds, provided there was no rain. Despite weather challenges, flight teams worked together to coordinate as many multi-aircraft flight days as possible, meeting the overall objective of the MAGEQ campaign. The MAGEQ team members pose in front of the P-3 aircraft at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia.Credit: NASA/Roy Johnson “It’s been inspiring to see how everybody worked together,” said Lesley Ott, research meteorologist and lead carbon cycle modeler for NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office at NASA Goddard. “By collecting data together, not only can we do a better job as scientists in having more complete understanding, we can also do a better job making usable data sets that meets the needs of different stakeholders.” State resource managers in North Carolina and Virginia, for example, could benefit from this data as they monitor the health of wetlands, which provide resilience to storms, absorb carbon from the atmosphere and support local tourist industries. The data could also help operators at energy-producing facilities detect methane leaks or equipment failures quickly. Faster detection could speed up intervention and minimize waste, as well as lessen environmental impacts. Stakeholders were an integral part of the planning process, Ott said. They made suggestions about measurement sites and data needs that informed the flight planning. Scientists will also use the measurements to verify satellite data from both public and commercial data providers. Satellites like the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) instrument collect similar data. Scientists can compare the airborne and satellite data to get a more complete picture of the atmosphere. They also will use MAGEQ data to evaluate atmospheric chemistry modeling from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model, which connects atmospheric, oceanic, and land data to help create a more comprehensive picture of Earth science. The MAGEQ team members from NOAA and NASA pose in front of the Twin Otter aircraft.

      "description": "",
      "content": "If you spend any significant amount of time using Steam, you've probably joked ruefully about your massive backlog of games acquired through cheap bundles or the service's frequent massive sales. However, we're willing to bet your backlog can't hold a candle to that of SonixLegend, who recently earned a unique Steam badge as the first person to own 40,000 distinct paid games on Valve's platform. Based in Shanghai, SonixLegend obtained their 40,000th Steam game this week, according to Steam's badge data, putting them atop an elite club of just 19 Steam users with at least 30,000 paid games. According to SteamDB tracking, that makes for an account roughly worth anywhere from $248,000 (based on the lowest prices ever tracked in the database) to $642,000 (based on the current prices of those games). However, SonixLegend's full collection might be more extensive than this massive achievement suggests. That's because Steam's Game Collector badges don't track any of the many, many shovelware titles that have failed to reach \"broad player engagement and some commercial success\" on the service under Valve's \"profile features\" guidelines. It also reportedly doesn't include almost all free-to-play games, which could easily be used to inflate a title count for determined badge chasers.Read full article Comments",

Credits: USFS/Cecilio Ricardo When wildfires scorch a landscape, the flames are just the beginning. NASA is helping communities across the nation foresee and prepare for what can follow: mudslides, flash flooding, and contaminated surface water supplies. A new online tool called HydroFlame, built with support from NASA’s Earth Science Division, relies on satellite data, hydrologic modeling, and artificial intelligence to predict how wildfires could affect water resources, from tap water to the rivers and streams where people fish. The project is being developed with the University of Texas at Arlington, Purdue University, the U.S. Geological Survey, and other partners. For now, the tool includes data only for Montana’s Clark Fork Basin, where it is being piloted. But new applications are underway in California and Utah. Researchers will soon begin fieldwork in Los Angeles County to collect on-the-ground data to refine HydroFlame’s predictive approach — an important step toward expanding it beyond the pilot site. “As wildfires intensify across the country, so do their ripple effects on regional water resources,” said Erin Urquhart, program manager for NASA’s water resources program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “HydroFlame could help communities in the U.S. see what’s coming and plan for it, before a fire becomes a water crisis.” That kind of foresight is exactly what local officials are looking for. “For someone managing a trout fishery or drinking water supply, knowing when a stream might be overwhelmed with debris after a fire can mean the difference between preparedness and a crisis,” said Morgan Valliant, who is part of the project’s advisory group and the associate director of ecosystem services for Missoula Parks and Recreation in Montana. “This tool could let us move from reacting to planning.” When fire reshapes land In the wake of a wildfire, charred hillsides are often unstable. With the protective blanket of plants burned away, rain that once soaked gently into the soil can race downhill, sending ash, debris, and sediment into rivers and reservoirs. That runoff can trigger flash floods and contaminate drinking water. Severe wildfires can also bake soil into a water-repelling crust. With less absorption, the same slopes can swing from drought to destructive floods, and those runoff risks can persist for decades. HydroFlame, developed by a team led by Adnan Rajib at the University of Texas at Arlington, is built to anticipate those extremes. “NASA is constantly pushing the boundaries when it comes to sensing and predicting fire,” Rajib said. “But there is still a huge gap when it comes to translating that fire information in terms of water. That’s where HydroFlame comes in.” The tool will include three components: a historical viewer that maps past fire impacts on streamflow and sediment a “what-if” scenario builder to simulate future fires a predictive tool that generates weekly forecasts using near-real-time satellite data as initial conditions When a wildfire is identified, the tool will identify how severely areas are burned across watersheds and track shifts in vegetation, soil wetness, and evapotranspiration, or the release of water from the land and plants to the atmosphere. HydroFlame uses data from satellite missions and instruments including MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), Landsat, and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive). Those observations, combined with stream records from gauged rivers, feed into simulations of possible fire-driven changes in water flow and quality. A machine-learning component will fill in where gauges are absent, making it possible to predict impacts up to two weeks in advance. This screenshot shows HydroFlame, a NASA-supported online tool that will help U.S. communities better understand and forecast how wildfires may affect water supplies in their region.A. Rajib The historical viewer, which is publicly accessible, lets users explore how past fires altered streamflow and sediment levels across the basin. The other components are still in development: The prototype of the “what-if” scenario builder tool is expected to launch in December 2025, with the full version planned for May 2026. HydroFlame’s ability to capture compounding factors — drought before a fire, flooding afterward — and simulate their cascading effects on water systems is what makes it different from other tools, Rajib said. “Many traditional models treat each fire as a one-off,” he said. “HydroFlame looks at the bigger picture.” Just as important, the tool is built for people who aren’t experts in satellite data. “It’s a practical starting point for scenario planning,” said Kelly Luis, associate program manager for NASA’s water resources program and an aquatic ecosystem scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. The tool’s “what-if” function, she explained, will let water managers, city planners, and other officials apply their local knowledge. For example, they might zero in on the rivers and streams most important to a city’s water supply. “That kind of insight is essential for building solutions that are both scientifically grounded and locally relevant.” For watershed organizations or local and state agencies with limited staff and resources, that ease of use is crucial — saving time and effort while helping keep costs down. “These groups need holistic ways to understand potential impacts of fires to their rivers and streams and plan, without always having to bring in someone from the outside,” said Amy Seaman, the executive director of the Montana Watershed Coordination Council. Seaman works with community watershed organizations across Montana and is also part of the project’s advisory group. This effort is part of a broader NASA focus on understanding how fire reshapes water systems and what that means for American communities. A real-world trial in Los Angeles Rajib’s team put HydroFlame’s predictive capabilities to the test during the January 2025 wildfires in Los Angeles. As fires burned through the region, researchers ran real-time model simulations using NASA satellite data, tracking changes in vegetation, soil moisture, and burn severity almost as they happened. By the end of the month, the team had generated forecasts for mud and debris flows expected in February. This false-color Landsat 9 image, acquired Jan. 14, shows burned areas from the 2025 fires in and around Los Angeles, highlighting unburned vegetation (green) and burned land (light to dark brown) using shortwave infrared, near infrared, and visible light. Similar types of NASA fire data are used in HydroFlame.NASA Earth Observatory Those predictions turned out to be accurate. In early February, mudflow events struck the areas of Altadena and Sierra Madre in Los Angeles County, following the Eaton Fire. HydroFlame had been run specifically for that fire and flagged both neighborhoods as at risk, Rajib said. “It wasn’t a formal, data-verified result because we didn’t have ground sensors in place,” Rajib said. “But it was a practical validation. The timing and severity of what we modeled lined up with what occurred.” Rajib’s team is now working with NASA JPL, the University of California, Merced and Los Angeles County to formally test and expand the tool in the Los Angeles area. The team plans to begin collecting on-the-ground data no earlier than Friday, Sept. 26. That work will include installing stream sensors to measure sediment levels in the county’s streams during California’s rainy season and integrating those data into the tool — a step toward building an early-warning system. HydroFlame invites those interested in the tool to share their ideas and feedback, and to get involved, through a web form available on the project’s Explore Tools webpage.

      "content": "When the bar is set at suggesting that people inject bleach into their veins, it's hard to reach a new low. But in a deranged press event on autism Monday evening, President Trump seemed to go for it—sharing \"rumors\" and his \"strong feelings\" not just on Tylenol but also his bonkers views on childhood vaccines. Trump was there with his health secretary, anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to link autism to the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy. While medical experts condemn the claim as unproven and dangerous (which it is), Kennedy's anti-vaccine followers decried it as a distraction from their favored false and dangerous explanation—that vaccines cause autism (which they don't). Pinning the blame on Tylenol instead of vaccines enraged Kennedy's own anti-vaccine organization, Children's Health Defense. In the run-up to the event Monday evening, CHD retweeted an all-caps defense of Tylenol, and CHD President Mary Holland called the announcement a \"sideshow\" in an interview with Steve Bannon.Read full article Comments",

      "description": "",
      "content": "On Tuesday, OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank announced plans for five new US AI data center sites for Stargate, their joint AI infrastructure project, bringing the platform to nearly 7 gigawatts of planned capacity and over $400 billion in investment over the next three years. The massive buildout aims to handle ChatGPT's 700 million weekly users and train future AI models, although critics question whether the investment structure can sustain itself. The companies said the expansion puts them on track to secure the full $500 billion, 10-gigawatt commitment they announced in January by the end of 2025. The five new sites will include three locations developed through an OpenAI and Oracle partnership: Shackelford County, Texas; Doña Ana County, New Mexico; and an unspecified Midwest location. These sites, along with a 600-megawatt expansion near the flagship Stargate site in Abilene, Texas, can deliver over 5.5 gigawatts of capacity, which means the computers on site will be able to draw up to 5.5 billion watts of electricity when running at full load. The companies expect the sites to create over 25,000 onsite jobs.Read full article Comments",

As a volunteer for the Lunar Melt Citizen Science Project, you’ll help identify and measure rocks and craters in images like this one.Credit: NASA/GSFC/Arizona State University When asteroids hit the Moon, the impacts carve out craters and with enough energy and pressure, melt parts of the rocky surface. Often, the white hot, gooey melt (it’s like lava, except that it doesn’t erupt from underground) sloshes around the new crater and surrounding regions. The molten rock cools and hardens into vast rock features called impact melt flow deposits. These flow deposits are sculpture-like abstract art with beautiful lines and textures. Now, scientists at the Lunar Melt citizen science project are asking for your help mapping these flows. You’ll be marking rocks, measuring the lengths of boulders, and outlining craters and melt deposits in images from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft. Your contributions will help reveal how impact melt has changed the Moon’s surface, especially around Little Lowell Crater and Tycho Crater, and help scientists use impact melt flows to learn about the moon’s interior.

      "description": "",
      "content": "Taiwan has begun evolving its trade strategy to start wielding its dominant position as a leading supplier of cutting-edge chips as a weapon, Bloomberg reported. The move comes amid Donald Trump's heightening global trade war and after years of Taiwan's use of its chip dominance as a shield against Chinese aggression, with Taiwan allying with the US to stave off China's threats of invasion. Under the so-called \"one-China principle,\" China has rejected Taiwan's independence, requiring allies to sever ties with Taiwan. On Tuesday, Taiwan announced that it would be limiting shipments of semiconductors into South Africa—among 47 restricted products—due to national security concerns. The rare export curbs could hit South Africa's \"electronics, telecom, and auto parts sectors\" hard, MSN reported, if South Africa doesn't meet with Taiwan to discuss better terms within the next 60 days.Read full article Comments",

La NASA y la Administración Nacional Oceánica y Atmosférica (NOAA, por sus siglas en inglés) lanzaron el miércoles tres nuevas misiones para investigar la influencia del Sol en todo el sistema solar. A las 7:30 a. m. EDT, un cohete Falcon 9 de SpaceX despegó del Complejo de Lanzamiento 39A del Centro Espacial Kennedy de la NASA en Florida, llevando a bordo las misiones Sonda de Cartografía y Aceleración Interestelar (IMAP, por su acrónimo en inglés) y el Observatorio Carruthers de la Geocorona, ambos de la NASA, y la nave espacial de Seguimiento de la Meteorología Espacial en el Punto de Lagrange 1 (SWFO-L1, por sus siglas en inglés) de la NOAA. “Este exitoso lanzamiento mejora la preparación de nuestro país ante las condiciones meteorológicas espaciales para proteger mejor nuestros satélites, misiones interplanetarias y astronautas que viajan al espacio de los peligros de la meteorología espacial en todo el sistema solar”, afirmó el administrador interino de la NASA, Sean Duffy. “Esta información será fundamental a medida que nos preparamos para futuras misiones a la Luna y Marte con la intención de mantener a Estados Unidos a la vanguardia en el espacio”. Estas misiones ayudarán a proteger de las duras condiciones de la meteorología espacial tanto a nuestra tecnología basada en tierra como a nuestros exploradores espaciales humanos y robóticos. “Mientras Estados Unidos se prepara para enviar a seres humanos de vuelta a la Luna y más adelante a Marte, la NASA y la NOAA están proporcionando la guía definitiva de supervivencia interplanetaria para dar apoyo a este épico viaje de la humanidad”, afirmó Nicola Fox, administradora asociada de la Dirección de Misiones Científicas de la sede central de la NASA en Washington. “Nuestros descubrimientos científicos e innovaciones técnicas se incorporan directamente a nuestro plan de acción know-before-you-go (infórmate antes de ir) para garantizar una presencia humana bien preparada, segura y continua en otros mundos”. Nueva ciencia para proteger a la sociedad Cada misión investigará los diferentes efectos de la meteorología espacial y el viento solar, el cual es un flujo continuo de partículas emitidas por el Sol, desde su origen en nuestra estrella hasta el espacio interestelar. “Estas tres misiones únicas nos ayudarán a conocer nuestro Sol y sus efectos sobre la Tierra mejor que nunca”, afirmó Joe Westlake, director de la División de Heliofísica en la sede central de la NASA. “Este conocimiento es fundamental, ya que la actividad solar afecta directamente a nuestra vida cotidiana, desde las redes eléctricas hasta el GPS. Estas misiones nos ayudarán a garantizar la seguridad y la resiliencia de nuestro mundo interconectado”. La misión IMAP trazará los límites de la heliosfera, una burbuja inflada por el viento solar que protege nuestro sistema solar de los rayos cósmicos galácticos. Esta es una protección clave que contribuye a que nuestro planeta sea habitable. Además, la nave espacial tomará muestras y medirá las partículas del viento solar que fluyen hacia el exterior desde el Sol, así como las partículas energéticas que fluyen hacia el interior desde los límites de nuestro sistema solar y más allá. “IMAP nos ayudará a comprender mejor cómo el entorno espacial puede perjudicarnos a nosotros y a nuestras tecnologías, y a descubrir la ciencia de nuestro vecindario solar”, afirmó David McComas, investigador principal de la misión IMAP en la Universidad de Princeton, en Nueva Jersey. El Observatorio Carruthers de la Geocorona es la primera misión dedicada a medir los cambios en la capa más externa de nuestra atmósfera, la exosfera, la cual juega un papel importante en cómo la Tierra responde a la meteorología espacial. Al estudiar la geocorona —el brillo ultravioleta que emite la exosfera cuando la luz del sol la ilumina— la misión Carruthers revelará cómo la exosfera responde a las tormentas solares y cómo cambia con las estaciones. La misión se basa en el legado del primer instrumento que capturó imágenes de la geocorona, el cual viajó a la Luna a bordo de Apolo 16 y fue construido y diseñado por el científico, inventor, ingeniero y educador Dr. George Carruthers. “La misión Carruthers nos mostrará cómo funciona la exosfera y nos ayudará a mejorar nuestra capacidad para predecir los efectos de la actividad solar aquí en la Tierra”, dijo Lara Waldrop, investigadora principal de la misión en la Universidad de Illinois en Urbana-Champaign. La nave SWFO-L1 de la NOAA, la primera de su tipo, está diseñada para ser un observatorio de meteorología espacial operativo a tiempo completo. Al vigilar la actividad solar y las condiciones espaciales cerca de la Tierra las 24 horas del día, los 7 días de la semana, sin interrupciones ni obstrucciones, SWFO-L1 proporcionará pronósticos de meteorología espacial más rápidos y precisos que nunca. “Se trata del primero de una nueva generación de observatorios de meteorología espacial de la NOAA dedicados a operaciones ininterrumpidas, que trabajarán para evitar lagunas en la continuidad. Las observaciones en tiempo real de SWFO-L1 proporcionarán a los operadores los datos fiables necesarios para emitir alertas tempranas, de modo que los responsables de la toma de decisiones puedan actuar con antelación para proteger las infraestructuras vitales, los intereses económicos y la seguridad nacional en la Tierra y en el espacio. Se trata de proteger a la sociedad contra los peligros de la meteorología espacial”, dijo Richard Ullman, subdirector de la Oficina de Observaciones de la Meteorología Espacial de la NOAA Siguientes pasos En las horas posteriores al lanzamiento, las tres naves espaciales se desplegaron desde el cohete con éxito y enviaron señales a la Tierra para confirmar que están activas y funcionando correctamente. Durante los próximos meses, los satélites se dirigirán a su destino, un lugar situado entre la Tierra y el Sol, a unos 1,6 millones de kilómetros de la Tierra, denominado punto de Lagrange 1 (L1). Se espera que lleguen en enero y, una vez completadas las comprobaciones y calibraciones de sus instrumentos, comiencen sus misiones para comprender mejor la meteorología espacial y proteger a la humanidad. David McComas, de la Universidad de Princeton, dirige la misión IMAP con un equipo internacional formado por 27 instituciones asociadas. El Laboratorio de Física Aplicada de la Universidad Johns Hopkins, ubicado en Laurel, Maryland, construyó la nave espacial y operará la misión. La misión del Observatorio Carruthers de la Geocorona está dirigida por Lara Waldrop, de la Universidad de Illinois Urbana-Champaign. La ejecución de la misión está a cargo del Laboratorio de Ciencias Espaciales de la Universidad de California, Berkeley, que también diseñó y construyó los dos generadores de imágenes ultravioletas. BAE Systems diseñó y construyó la nave espacial Carruthers. La División de Proyectos de Exploradores y Heliofísica de la NASA en el Centro de Vuelo Espacial Goddard de la NASA en Greenbelt, Maryland, gestiona las misiones IMAP y Observatorio Carruthers de la Geocorona para la Dirección de Misiones Científicas de la NASA. La misión SWFO-L1 está gestionada por la NOAA y desarrollada en colaboración con el centro Goddard de la NASA y socios comerciales. El Programa de Servicios de Lanzamiento de la NASA, con sede en el centro Kennedy de la NASA, gestiona el servicio de lanzamiento de las misiones.

      "description": "",
      "content": "For years, Customs and Border Protection agents have been quietly harvesting DNA from American citizens, including minors, and funneling the samples into an FBI crime database, government data shows. This expansion of genetic surveillance was never authorized by Congress for citizens, children, or civil detainees. According to newly released government data analyzed by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy & Technology, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, collected the DNA of nearly 2,000 US citizens between 2020 and 2024 and had it sent to CODIS, the FBI’s nationwide system for policing investigations. An estimated 95 were minors, some as young as 14. The entries also include travelers never charged with a crime and dozens of cases where agents left the “charges” field blank. In other files, officers invoked civil penalties as justification for swabs that federal law reserves for criminal arrests. The findings appear to point to a program running outside the bounds of statute or oversight, experts say, with CBP officers exercising broad discretion to capture genetic material from Americans and have it funneled into a law-enforcement database designed in part for convicted offenders. Critics warn that anyone added to the database could endure heightened scrutiny by US law enforcement for life.Read full article Comments",

      "description": "",
      "content": "The idea of using an electric vehicle's battery to send energy from the EV to the electrical grid is not a new idea. Ars first covered the technology, known as vehicle-to-grid or V2G, back in 2009 when Ford and American Electric Power in Ohio started playing with the idea, although that pilot involved hybrids rather than battery EVs. A couple of years later, General Motors tried something similar with the plug-in hybrid Volt, and since then, battery EVs with much larger lithium-ion packs have gotten in on the act, although such pilot programs have invariably involved commercial EV fleets. More recently, we've started seeing EVs that have been designed from the ground up to be capable of bidirectional charging. And since July, some owners of Ford F-150 Lightnings have been sending stored energy back into the grid between 5 pm and 9 pm on weekdays, earning them some cash in the process. Sunrun, which provides home energy storage and solar solutions, started working with Baltimore Gas and Electric Company on the project last year. This summer, it expanded its work to include the nation's first residential V2G pilot, with a trio of Lightning owners using Sunrun and Ford's Home Integration System. Participants can earn up to $1,000 from the program, which runs until the end of this month.Read full article Comments",

      "description": "",
      "content": "Servers running on motherboards sold by Supermicro contain high-severity vulnerabilities that can allow hackers to remotely install malicious firmware that runs even before the operating system, making infections impossible to detect or remove without unusual protections in place. One of the two vulnerabilities is the result of an incomplete patch Supermicro released in January, said Alex Matrosov, founder and CEO of Binarly, the security firm that discovered it. He said that the insufficient fix was meant to patch CVE-2024-10237, a high-severity vulnerability that enabled attackers to reflash firmware that runs while a machine is booting. Binarly discovered a second critical vulnerability that allows the same sort of attack. “Unprecedented persistence” Such vulnerabilities can be exploited to install firmware similar to ILObleed, an implant discovered in 2021 that infected HP Enterprise servers with wiper firmware that permanently destroyed data stored on hard drives. Even after administrators reinstalled the operating system, swapped out hard drives, or took other common disinfection steps, ILObleed would remain intact and reactivate the disk-wiping attack. The exploit the attackers used in that campaign had been patched by HP four years earlier but wasn’t installed in the compromised devices.Read full article Comments",

      "content": "Director Andy Muschietti's two-film adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel IT racked up over $1 billion at the box office worldwide. Now Muschietti is back with a nine-episode prequel series for HBO, IT: Welcome to Derry, exploring the origins of Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgård), the ancient evil that terrorized the fictional town every 27 years. And now we have an official trailer a month before the prequel's October debut. (Some spoilers below for IT and IT: Chapter Two.) As previously reported, set in 1989, IT essentially adapted half of King's original novel, telling the story of a group of misfit kids calling themselves \"The Losers Club.\" The kids discover their small town of Derry is home to an ancient, trans-dimensional evil that awakens every 27 years to prey mostly on children by taking the form of an evil clown named Pennywise. Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) loses his little brother, Georgie, to Pennywise, and the group decides to take on Pennywise and drive him into early hibernation, where he will hopefully starve. But Beverly (Sophia Lillis) has a vision warning that Pennywise will return on schedule in 27 years, and they must be ready to fight him anew.Read full article Comments",

      "description": "",
      "content": "If an Iranian taxi driver waves away your payment, saying, \"Be my guest this time,\" accepting their offer would be a cultural disaster. They expect you to insist on paying—probably three times—before they'll take your money. This dance of refusal and counter-refusal, called taarof, governs countless daily interactions in Persian culture. And AI models are terrible at it. New research released earlier this month titled \"We Politely Insist: Your LLM Must Learn the Persian Art of Taarof\" shows that mainstream AI language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta fail to absorb these Persian social rituals, correctly navigating taarof situations only 34 to 42 percent of the time. Native Persian speakers, by contrast, get it right 82 percent of the time. This performance gap persists across large language models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Llama 3, DeepSeek V3, and Dorna, a Persian-tuned variant of Llama 3. A study led by Nikta Gohari Sadr of Brock University, along with researchers from Emory University and other institutions, introduces \"TAAROFBENCH,\" the first benchmark for measuring how well AI systems reproduce this intricate cultural practice. The researchers' findings show how recent AI models default to Western-style directness, completely missing the cultural cues that govern everyday interactions for millions of Persian speakers worldwide.Read full article Comments",

      "content": "It's not exactly hard to find politically conservative content on YouTube, but the platform may soon skew even further to the right. YouTube parent Alphabet has confirmed that it will restore channels that were banned in recent years for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and elections. Alphabet says it values free expression and political debate, placing the blame for its previous moderation decisions on the Biden administration. Alphabet made this announcement via a lengthy letter to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). The letter, a response to subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee, explains in no uncertain terms that the company is taking a more relaxed approach to moderating political content on YouTube. For starters, Alphabet denies that its products and services are biased toward specific viewpoints and that it \"appreciates the accountability\" provided by the committee. The cloying missive goes on to explain that Google didn't really want to ban all those accounts, but Biden administration officials just kept asking. Now that the political tables have turned, Google is looking to dig itself out of this hole.Read full article Comments",

The problem for Carr is that lots of people heard him do exactly that last week. \"There's a lot of Democrats out there that are engaged in a campaign of projection and distortion,\" Carr said during an on-stage interview at the Concordia Summit yesterday. \"The distortion is they're completely misrepresenting the work of the FCC and what we've been doing. I saw there's a letter from some Senate Democrats that said the FCC threatened to revoke the license of Disney and ABC if they didn't fire Jimmy Kimmel, and that did not happen in any way, shape, or form.\" While Carr complained that Democrats interpreted his comments as a threat to Disney, he didn't mention that his comments were also interpreted as a threat by several prominent Senate Republicans. Disney suspended Kimmel's show last week after Carr said ABC affiliates could have licenses revoked for \"news distortion,\" but reinstated Kimmel yesterday after facing backlash from the public. Kimmel will be back on the air on many ABC-affiliated stations, but not those run by Nexstar and Sinclair, which have replaced Jimmy Kimmel Live! with news and other programming.Read full article Comments",

In 2008, when Apple took the very first MacBook Air out of a manila envelope, it was not positioned as Apple's new entry-level Mac laptop. The innovative but flawed system started at $1,799, far above the $999 price of the entry-level plastic MacBook and well into MacBook Pro territory. In those early, formative years, the \"Air\" branding denoted not a midrange or entry-level model but an alternate branching path from the baseline MacBook. Paying Apple more money could get you more computer—the Pro model, with more processor, more screen, more storage, more everything—or it could get you a different kind of computer, with fundamentally different benefits and trade-offs.Read full article Comments",

      "description": "",
      "content": "It's a rare occurrence for scientists to witness sharks mating in the wild. It's even rarer to catch three leopard sharks—two males and one female—engaging in what amounts to a threesome in the wild on camera, particularly since they are considered an endangered species. But that's just what one enterprising marine biology team achieved, describing the mating sequence in careful, clinical detail in a paper published in the Journal of Ethology. It's not like scientists don't know anything about leopard shark mating behavior; rather, most of that knowledge comes from studying the sharks in captivity. Whether the behavior is identical in the wild is an open question because there hadn't been any documented observations of leopard shark mating practices in the wild—until now. Hugo Lassauce, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) in Australia, was working with the Aquarium des Lagons in Nouméa, New Caledonia, to monitor sharks off the coast of that South Pacific territory. Lassauce has been snorkeling daily with sharks for a year as part of that program—always with an accompanying boat for safety purposes—and had seen bits of the leopard shark mating behavior before, but never the entire sequence. Then he spotted a female shark on the sand below with two males hanging onto her pectoral fins—classic pre-copulation (courtship) behavior observed in captive leopard sharks.Read full article Comments",
