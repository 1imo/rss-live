        NewsHub operates as a news aggregation service, collecting and organizing content from established news sources to provide readers with timely access to current events across technology, business, sports, politics, and international affairs.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Editorial Approach</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        We maintain strict editorial standards by sourcing content exclusively from established news organizations with proven track records of journalistic integrity. Each article retains full attribution to its original publisher, with direct links to source material to preserve context and enable readers to access complete reporting.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibent text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Content Standards</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        All content is automatically sourced from RSS feeds provided by recognized news organizations. We do not alter, edit, or republish original reporting. Our role is limited to aggregation, categorization, and presentation of headlines and summaries as provided by the original publishers.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Content updates occur continuously throughout the day as new stories are published by our source outlets. We maintain no editorial position on the content we aggregate and encourage readers to visit source publications for complete coverage and analysis.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Technical Infrastructure</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        The platform operates on modern web infrastructure designed for performance and reliability. Automated systems monitor source feeds and update content indexes to ensure timely delivery of breaking news. The service is optimized for fast loading across desktop and mobile devices.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Source Attribution</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Every article includes clear attribution to its original publisher, publication date, and direct linking to the source material. We respect copyright and intellectual property rights of all content creators and maintain compliance with fair use principles governing news aggregation services.
